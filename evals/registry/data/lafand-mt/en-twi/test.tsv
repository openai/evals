A 72-year old trader Elizabeth Amoah, narrating her ordeal to the media, revealed the MP promised to refund her money after the 2020 general elections but has since refused to even respond to her calls.

“I went to Begoro during the 2020 campaign season to demand my money but the MP apologized to me and promised to pay it soon after the election is over. It is sad to inform you that, the MP has not been picking my calls since after the elections, which he won,” she lamented.	ɔde too dwa sɛ, “Mekɔɔ Begoro sɛ ɔrekɔgye ne sika berɛ 2020 abatoɔ aporɔbɔ rekɔ so no na mmarahyɛbɛdwani yi paa no akyɛw hyɛɛ no bɔ sɛ sɛ wɔde abatoɔ no wie a, ɔde ne sika bɛma no. ɛyɛ awerɛho sɛ, yɛtoo aba no wieeɛ no a mmarahyɛbɛdwani yi dii nkonim no, mefrɛɛ mmarahyɛbɛdwani yi wɔ tetefone so maa no mfaa da.”

Another victim stated “we are pleading with President Akufo Addo and the speaker, Kennedy Agyapong to intervene I am a strong NPP supporter but this MP is treating us bad.

“We looked at it meticulously and realized that it has met all the conditions and parliament approval was condition precedent.

Residents in the Ajumako Ochiso Community of the Central region are excited beyond measure as a mammoth quantity of fish has appeared in their river [Ochi], which used to be just a source of drinking water for them.

Speaking to Kasapa FM’s central regional correspondent Yaw Boagyan, Wofa Yaw Obosu who used to work at the bank of the river narrated that this has never happened since he came into the area and he also believes it’s a blessing for the community.

According to him, they will send some of the fishes to the market for sale. “Since the fishes appeared at the river bank, I have been able to employ over twenty youth to work for me to process for sale at the Mankessim, Kasoa, markets.”	ɔkyerɛɛ sɛ wɔde mpataa no bi bɛkɔ dwa so akɔtɔn. “Berɛ a mpataa baa asubɔtene no mu, mafa mmaubunu a wɔborɔ aduonu adwuma a wɔtɔ mpataa no wɔ Mankessin ne Kasoa dwom.”
“This is beyond my understanding since something of this nature has never happened in the Ajumako Ochiso Community.”	“ɛborɔ me nteaseɛ so ɛsiane sɛ biribi sei nsii da wɔ Aɛumako Oɔhiso mpɔtam yi da.”
Meanwhile, some of the residents who came went the scene also appealed to the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture to come and assist them in terms of providing them with tricycles to be able to transport the fishes to the market.

The Executive Director for the Institute of Energy Security, Nana Amoasi VII, has taken a swipe at the Attorney General, Godfred Dame, describing him as negligent for his failure to defend Ghana on the $170 million judgment debt awarded to power company, The Ghana Power Generation Company (GCGP).

The court in a ruling on Wednesday, June 8, refused to grant the government of Ghana an extension to apply to set aside the award – adding that the state’s grounds for challenging it were “intrinsically weak”.

The three-member arbitration tribunal chaired by John Beechey, a former President of the International Criminal Court’s Court of Arbitration, and co-chaired by Prof Albert Fiadjoe, a Ghanaian academic, sided with the power producer and awarded almost US$170 million, including interest.

Out of the total, U$134.35 million represents the early termination payment claim, which itself is made up of US $69.36 million as an early termination fee, US$58.49 million for mobilisation costs, US$6.46 million as demobilisation cost and US$32,448 as preservation and maintenance cost.

The tribunal also awarded US$614,353.86 against the country as the cost of the tribunal, and costs of US$3 million against Ghana, being the legal fees expended by the GPGC during the arbitration.

Major highlights of the tribunal’s decision included the fact that the Ahenkora Committee which recommended the termination of the contract did not have sufficient ground in coming to the conclusion that the GPGC was entitled to only $US18 million in early termination fees.

The tribunal, in dismissing Ghana’s case, delved into the basis for terminating the contract, stating that the evidence before it indicated that “GPGC did have a building permit for the Blue Ocean Site issued by the Kpone-Katamanso District Assembly on August 15, 2017.”	Kɔɔto no rebɔ Ghana aban no asɛm no aguo no, wɔdɔɔ asukɔ kɔɔ kɔntraagye a wɔtwaa mu no kyerɛɛ sɛ nnyinasoɔ a wɔgyinaa so de twaa kɔntraagye no mu no kyerɛɛ sɛ GPGɔ wɔ tumi nkrataa a Kpone-Katamanso mansini asɛmbele no dee maa wɔn fa Blue Oɔean asase no wɔ ɔsanaa da a ɛtɔ so du-num wɔ afe 2017 mu.
“GoG [The government] has not been able to adduce any statute or regulation, including the Energy Commission Act, which addresses the requirement for any such additional construction permit,” the Tribunal ruled.

“On the basis of the record as it now stands, it is apparent that even as Dr. Ahenkorah [Energy Commission Executive Secretary at the time] was putting up further hurdles over which he required GPGC to jump in pursuit of its provisional generation license in November 2017, the Minister of Energy was about to seek the approval of the Ghanaian Parliament of a decision to terminate the EPA along with a number of other PPAs, based upon the Report of the PPA Committee chaired by Dr. Ahenkorah,” it said.

Under British law, the government had 28 days to challenge the tribunal’s decision. However, it went to sleep only to appear in court three days to the expiry of the deadline to ask for an extension.

However, the court set March 8, 2021, for the Government to file the processes to challenge the Tribunal’s decision in January. But again, the government took a long nap until April 1, 2021, before filing. This time, another British law firm, Volterra Fietta, had instructions from the government to begin the process.

The law firm, which tagged itself as the only dedicated public international law firm in the world, explained that the new Attorney General, Godfred Yeboah Dame, had only been sworn in on March 5, and the firm received the directive to represent Ghana 10 days later.

But ruling on the matter on June 8, 2021, the court had no sympathies. It said the excuses were unreasonable and “intrinsically weak.”	Kɔɔto no de n’atemmuo reto dwa wɔ Kɔtɔnima da a ɛtɔ so nwɔtwe, 2021, wɔkyerɛ sɛ nsɛm a wɔde reto dwa no nyinaa mu ntɔ asom na ɛmu nyɛ du.
The presiding judge, Justice Butcher did not hold back.	ɔtɛmmuafoɔ, Justice Butɔher atwentwɛn ne nan ase koraa.
The judge said the government’s delay was “significant and substantial” as its request for a second extension had come 38 days after the statutory deadline and 27 days after the first extension expired, the Global Arbitration Review (GAR) reported.

According to Kan Dapaah, the move became necessary after several attempts to get the security Coordinator to vacate post after the termination of his appointment proved futile.

The ejected coordinator told Starr News he was evicted by members of NPP affiliated vigilante group, Delta Force, who assaulted him in the process for failing to do their bidding in the region.

But answering questions from South Dayi MP Rockson-Nelson Dafeamekpo, the national security minister explained the men dispatched were national security operatives.

He, however, refused to disclose reasons for the termination of the appointment of Mr. Opare-Addo insisting the use of force was necessary under the circumstances.	Na mmom, wankyerɛ sɛnti a wɔtuu Mr. Opare-Addo adeɛ so a ɔrekyerɛ sɛ na ɛho hia sɛ wɔde ɔhyɛ tu no adeɛ so.
“He [Opare-Addo] was on a three-year contract to serve as the Ashanti regional security liaison officer after the expiration of an initial two-year contract which began on January 5th, 2018. His new appointment took effect from January 1, 2020, and was to expire on December 31, 2022.”	Na Opare-Addo de ne nsa ahyɛ mfeɛ mmiɛnsa kɔntraagye ase sɛ ɔbɛyɛ Asante mantam mu bammɔ adwuma ntotoeɛfoɔ berɛ ne mfeɛ mmienu kɔntraagye a ɛhyɛɛ aseɛ wɔ ɔpɛpɔn da a ɛtɔ so nnum wɔ 2018 mu (kɔntraagye a ɛdi kan noɔ no baa n’awieeɛ.
“However, his appointment was terminated on February 19, 2021, by the national security coordinator. Upon the termination of his contract, DCOP Opare-Addo was paid his entitlements as per his appointment letter. Subsequent to the termination of the appointment, the ministry appointed Col Francis Arthur (rtd) as the new Ashanti regional security liaison officer. The colonel’s appointment took effect from 1st May 2021. But he [Opare-Addo] refused to hand over to Colonel Francis Arthur. He then declined numerous invitations from the national security coordinator to explain his refusal to vacate the office.”	“Na mmom, ɔman bammu ntotoeɛfoɔ tuu no adeɛ so wɔ ɔgyefoɔ da a ɛtɔ so du-nkron mu wɔ 2021 mu.

Mr Dapaah further explained “Meanwhile, his continuous stay in office obstructed the work of the new regional security liaison officer. Against this backdrop, personnel from the ministry of national security were on 11th May 2021 dispatched to the Ashanti region to ascertain the reason for DCOP Opare Addo’s refusal to vacate his office. And if it became necessary to change the locks of the door to his office. On arrival, the personnel duly introduced themselves but were met with acts of hostility from DCOP Opare-Addo, including drawing his sidearm. The personnel managed to persuade him and retrieved the sidearm.”	Mr Dapaah san nso kyerɛɛ mu sɛ, “ɛsiane sɛ wannyae ne dwumadie no mu nti, na mantam no bammɔ adwuma ntotoeɛfoɔ foforɔ no a waba no ntumi nyɛ n’adwuma.

He added “till date, no official complaint has been made by DCOP Opare-Addo either to his immediate boss the national security coordinator or to me as the sector minister regarding the alleged assault on him. Neither has the minister of national security received any correspondence from the police in relation to the allegations.”	ɔde kaa ho bio sɛ, “Bɛsi nnɛ DCOP Opare-Addo mfa biribiara nkɔtoo ɔman bammɔ adwuma ntotoeɛfoɔ anim anaa me a meyɛ sɛkhyin soafoɔ anim sɛ obi de ne nsa aka no.

Some youth groups in the Ashanti region have threatened to shut down branches of the Lighthouse Chapel International in the region over a critical sermon delivered by the leader of the church Bishop Dag Heward-Mills which appeared to attack the Ashanti Monarch Otumfuo Osei Tutu.

Bishop Dag Heward-Mills has however apologised over the sermon.	ɔsofo panin Dag Heward Mills apa akyɛw.
In an apology, the Preacher said: “I am deeply saddened that a message I shared at a conference, nearly 20 years ago, has been taken out of its context and circulated by persons who have previously declared that they will maliciously cause our churches in Kumasi to be closed down.	ɔsɛmpakafoɔ no akyɛwpa mu no, ɔde too dwa sɛ, “Me werɛ aho sɛ nsɛm a mede too dwa mfeɛ aduonu nie na nkorɔfoɔ bi a wɔse wɔbɛfa kwan biara so ama wɔatoto yɛn nsɔre a ɛwɔ Kumasi mu afa adane ani.

“Public confidence in the judiciary must be earned and not forced on us.

He added that “The judiciary, like parliament or executive, is not above criticism…Our laws and constitution protect the integrity and independence of the judiciary and not the sensibility of a judge.

Afghanistan is the least peaceful country in the world for the fourth consecutive year, followed by Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, and Iraq.

According to the report, half of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had a recent experience of violence. Those living in Namibia had the highest experience of violence in the world at 6 per cent.

The largest deterioration in peacefulness in the region occurred in Burkina Faso. This was also the single largest deterioration of any country. The government’s decision to fund and arm civilian auxiliary groups in its fight against insurgents drove the plunge.	ɔman a wɔwɔ saa beaeɛ hɔ a asomdwoeɛ akɔ fam koraa wɔ mu ne Burkina Faso, na wɔsene ɔman biara.

The report said Covid was a “multiplying force” in future political instability and civil unrest. It added the level of this unrest going forward is likely to hinge on the speed and effectiveness of economic recovery. Countries with less debt and higher levels of positive peace were more likely to recover faster.

Despite this, overall three-quarters of people globally feel as safe or safer today than they did five years ago.

The Index also revealed that “the average level of global peacefulness deteriorated by 0.07 per cent in the 2021 Global Peace Index. Although a relatively small deterioration, this is the ninth time in the last 13 years that global peacefulness has deteriorated”.

The report added that “in the past year, 87 countries recorded an improvement in peacefulness, while 73 countries recorded a deterioration. Three countries recorded no change in their overall score. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region remained the world’s least peaceful region. It is home to three of the five least peaceful countries in the world. However, it recorded the largest regional improvement over the past year”.

Over 60% of deaths in Ghana, according to available statistics, are as a result of unavailable ambulance service to transport women in labour and accident victims to the appropriate medical facility.

“The president has indicated clearly that all the costs of the burn victims from this incident will be covered by the state, so we’ve made it clear to the management and the Brigadier General-in-charge, the commandant, that they should quickly put together all the logistics and costs of caring for these patients.	“ɔmampanin kyerɛ sɛ ɔman no bɛfa ɛka biara a ɛbɛba wɔ wɔn a wɔpiraa wɔ atowerɛkyɛm yi ho no, nti momma no nto wɔn a wɔda ayaresabea ahodoɔ no ano sɛ wɔmmoammoa ɛka no nyinaa ano.”
“As you know with burn victims, there is the need to constantly wash, constantly change dressing, and put them on antibiotics and very strong pain killers, so there is for each patient a cost.

The Minister of Energy, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, has said the Government is working towards boosting Ghana's industrialisation with clean and reliable energy systems, such as nuclear and renewables.	ɔsoafoɔ a ɔhwɛ ogyahoɔden so, Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh de ato dwa sɛ aban no reyɛ deɛ ɛwɔ sɛ ɔyɛ biara sɛdeɛ mfididwuma a ɛwɔ Ghana anya anyinam kanea de ayɛ wɔn nnwuma na wɔatu mpɔn.
He said there was a growing consensus that nuclear energy had an important role in decarbonising electricity generation for accelerated industrial development.	ɔde too dwa sɛ nnipa dodoɔ no ara gye tom sɛ owiagyahoɔden ho hia sɛdeɛ ɛbɛyɛ a mfididwuma bɛtu mpɔn.
“While renewable energy sources are expected to continue to grow significantly, nuclear power, an important part of today’s clear energy, is also the largest source of lower-carbon electricity generation in advanced economies, providing approximately 40 percent of all low carbon generations,” he said.	ɔde kaa sɛ, “Owiagyahoɔden yɛ anyinam ahoɔden a ɛmma kaabɔn a ɛho hia pa ara, na ɛno na aman a wɔakɔ wɔn anim no de di dwuma wɔ wɔn man mu a ɛreboa ma wɔn sikasɛm kɔ soro.”
He referred to an International Energy Agency report on clean energy system asserting that without nuclear investment, achieving a sustainable energy system would be much harder with implications to emissions, cost and energy security.	ɔgyinaa International Energy Agency nhwehwɛmu a ɛfa anyinam ahoɔden mapa so de too dwa sɛ, sɛ wɔmfa sika ahyɛ owiagyahoɔden mu a, ɛbɛyɛ den sɛ wɔbɛnya anyinam ahoɔden mapa a ɛso nsunsuansoɔ no nyɛ papa.
Dr Opoku Prempeh stated this, in a speech read on his behalf, at a Stakeholders Forum on Ghana’s Nuclear Power Programme in Accra.

Dr Opoku Prempeh noted that turning to clean energy systems for electricity generation would also decarbonise other areas, such as transportation, and other environmental pollution activities.	Dr Opoku Prempeh kyerɛ sɛ nhyehyɛeɛ yi bɛma mframa a ɛfiri lɔɔre mu ne nnoɔma a wɔhyehye no mu so aba fam.
"""Within Ghana’s power generation side, issues on consistent demand growth, high tariff for industries, affordability, reliability, and resilience criteria have brought to the fore the issue of an alternative base-load power,"" he stated."	“ɔde too dwa sɛ, nsɛnsɛm a ɛwɔ anyinam ahoɔden sɛ dabiara wɔbɛnya bi ne ne boɔ a ɛyɛ den ma nnwumakuo ama ɛho abɛhia sɛ yɛbɛnya adeɛ foforɔ bi a ɛbɛma anyinam ahoɔden wɔ Ghana man mu.”
Considering the facts available on the country's energy needs, capacity, cost and other related issues, nuclear energy, he said, could provide that alternative clean base-load power.	ɔkyerɛ sɛ sɛ yɛhwɛ ɔman no hia a ɛhia anyinam ahoɔden, anyinam ahoɔden no boɔ ne ne dodoɔ ne deɛ owiagyahoɔden nsɛm a ɛkeka ho a, ɛbɛtumi ama yɛanya kilin lɔɔd anyinam ahoɔden.
“A new nuclear power station does not only generate reliable low carbon electricity but also provides wider social-economic benefits both during its development, construction and the subsequent 60 years that the plant would be in operation.”	ɛnyɛ kaabɔn a ɛwɔ fam anyinam ahoɔden nko ara na owiagyahoɔden foforɔ de ba na mmom, ɛboa ma ɔman no tu mpɔn mmerɛ tenten a wɔde bɛyɛ adwuma nyinaa.
He recalled that in 2007, former President John Agyekum Kufuor set up a committee, chaired by Professor Daniel Adzei-Bekoe, to explore the possibility of Ghana using nuclear energy as an alternative based-load source of power.	ɔde too dwa sɛ 2017 mu ɔmampanin dadaa John Agyekum Kufuor tee kɔmitee a na Professor Daniel Adzei-Bekoe na na ɔda ano sɛ wɔnyɛ nhwehwɛmu nhwɛ sɛ, so owiagyahoɔden bɛtumi ama Ghana nyinaa anyinam nkanea anaa?
This was around the time that Ghana was faced with supply power challenges.	Saa mmerɛ no na Ghana wɔ anyinam kanea ho haw pa ara.
To sustain the natural progression of the country’s technological energy advancement, he noted, subsequent governments had supported this effort to improve the country’s energy security to provide leadership and resources to facilitate the nuclear power programme.	Sɛdeɛ ɔman no anyinam ahoɔden ho nsɛm bɛtu mpɔn nti, ɔde too dwa sɛ aban ɔte so ne wɔn a wɔaba akɔ nyinaa de nhyehyɛeɛ guu akwan mu sɛ ɛbɛyɛ a owiagyahoɔden ho nhyehyɛeɛ bɛtu mpɔn.
This has given birth to the NPG to become the owner/operator of Ghana’s first nuclear power plant.	Wei na ɛmaa NPG bɔɔdo a, ɛno na ɛhwɛ Ghana owiagyahoɔden a ɛdi kan so.
He said the NPG Board, under the chairmanship of Mr Fred Oware, was focused on providing relevant resources to build a strong safety culture and resilience management systems that adhered to standards in the planning and development of nuclear infrastructure and related activities across the country.	ɔde too dwa sɛ NPG bɔɔdo a na Mr Fred Oware da ano no no, wɔde wɔn ani kɔɔ akadeɛ ɛho bɛhia a ɛbɛboa ama wɔde nhyehyɛeɛ mapa agu akwan mu ama owiagyahoɔden dwumadie atu mpɔn wɔ ɔman no mu.
In addition to electricity generation, nuclear energy, the Minister said, could provide solutions to an even wider range of applications - those innovative nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors would complement existing large reactors to enable deep decarbonization as part of the clean energy transition.	ɔsoafoɔ no de kaa ho sɛ sɛ yɛyi anyinam kanea a yɛbɛnya afiri owiagyahoɔden mu si nkyɛn a, ɛbɛtumi nso aboa ama mframa bɔne a ɛwɔ ɔman no mu so ate.

From an initial 28.5 million tax stams affixed in 2018, the number increased to 38.5 million the following year and 70.2 million in 2020, with managers of the project projecting to affix some 90 million stamps in 2021.

The Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) said it was also engaging the Food and Beverages Association of Ghana (FABAG) and local manufacturers to pay for the affixing of the stamps on their beverage products at the stamping facilities.

The Ghanaian printing company, Buck Press, and its partner, DelaRue, a British security printing company, are responsible for printing the tax stamps on behalf of the GRA, while Streamline Resources, which is located at the Tema Port, assists companies without the technical capacity to fix the stamps on individual products.

The Project Manager of Excise Tax Stamp at the GRA, Mr Kwabena Apau Awuah Anto, who disclosed this, said the move would reduce the incidence of product fraud and piracy, where importers and manufacturers applied for the stamps for specific products but affixed them on pirated products that had no approval and safety certification from the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA).

Speaking during a tour of the tax stamp facilities at the Tema Port by a team from the Graphic Communications Group Limited (GCGL) last Thursday, Mr Anto noted that the Commissioner General of the GRA had already granted authorisation to some 34 large importers and manufacturers, including Guinness Ghana Limited and the Coca-Cola Bottling Company, to undertake the affixing of the stamps at their factories at their own cost.	ɔrekasa wɔ berɛ a Graphic Communications Group Limited (GCGL) kɔɔ aporɔbɔ wɔ ɛtoɔ ahyɛnso nnwumakuo mu wɔ Tema Port da Yawoada no, Mr Anto de too dwa sɛ GRA krakye panin ama adwumakuo ahodoɔ aduasa nnan a Guiness Ghana Limited ne Coca-Cola Bottling company kwan sɛ wɔn ara wɔnyɛ wɔn ahyɛnso wɔ wɔn ankasa adwuma mu.
The GGCL team, which was led by the Managing Director, Mr Ato Afful, included the Editor of the Daily Graphic, Mr Kobby Asmah; the Director, Marketing, Mr Franklin Sowa, and the Editor of The Mirror, Ms Doreen Hammond.

The team was in Tema to have firsthand appreciation of progress of the excise tax stamp policy and also explore collaboration with the GRA on how to further advance the initiative.

Mr Anto said the excise stamp policy would reduce product fraud and ensure that only wholesome products were allowed into the market space to ensure public health and safety..

Similarly, he said, the policy would ensure revenue assurance and further level the playing field for importers and manufacturers to compete fairly on the market through the payment of appropriate taxes.

Mr Anto said: “What we do here at the Tema facilities and 13 other stations across the country where we have affixing facilities is at no cost to importers.”	Mr Anto de too dwa sɛ, “Dwumadie a yɛdi no wɔ Tema ha ne mmeaeɛ du mmiɛnsa a ɛwɔ ɔman no mu no a yɛde ahyɛnso taretare nnoɔma ho no, yɛnnye wɔn a wɔkra nnoɔma ba nnoɔma no mu sika.”
Operating the facilities, he said, came with headline costs such as the procurement of the stamps, utility, labour, operational cost and materials such as shrink wraps	ɛka a wɔbɔ wɔn dwuma no ho bi ne sika a wɔde tɔ ahyɛnso no, sika a wɔde tua adwumayɛfoɔ no ka ne akadeɛ nso ho ka.
He indicated that when the project took off in 2018, the government decided to give a six-month window to supply the stamps for free, but that had continued till date, hence the Commissioner General's directive for the stakeholders to be engaged and sensitised to the need for them to pay.	ɔkyerɛ sɛ berɛ dwumadie yi hyɛɛ aseɛ wɔ 2018 no, aban yɛɛ sɛ obiara ntua hwee wɔ ahyɛnso no ho na saa toaa so bɛsi nnɛ.

The engagements, Mr Anto said, would determine whether the GRA would charge the full cost or there would be cost sharing between it and the stakeholders.	Mr Anto kyerɛ sɛ nhyiamudie yi bɛkyerɛ sɛ GRA bɛma ɔman no nnipa bɛtua sika no nyinaa anaasɛ wɔne ɔman no mu nnipa no bɛkyɛ ka no atua.

Ghana's policy on the tax stamp policy places the responsibility on the affected excise product on the importer or the manufacturer.	Ghana ahyɛnso toɔ nhyehyɛeɛ no de asodie no to deɛ wɔrekra nnoɔma no reba no so anaasɛ adwumakuo no so.
In many countries where similar policies are implemented, manufacturers have affixing facilities at their production units,” Mr Anto said.	Aman ahodoɔ a saa wɔdi saa nhyehyɛeɛ yi nso di dwuma no mu no, adwumakuo ahodoɔ no ara na wɔde ahyɛnso no tare wɔn nnoɔma ho.
On the recent challenges that saw delays and congestion at the facility, which led to an outcry among importers, Mr Anto explained that the Tema facilities were not meant for large volume importers but for people who only imported occasionally.	Mr Anto kyerɛɛ n’adwene faa ɔhaw a na Tema beaeɛ no rekɔ mu sɛ wɔntumi mfa ahyɛnso no mma berɛ ano berɛ ano. ɔde too dwa sɛ, Tema hɔ deɛ, dwumadie a wɔdi no kɔma wɔn a mmerɛ bi wɔ hɔ na wɔkra nnoɔma na mmom wɔanyɛ ama wɔn a daa ne daa nyinaa na wɔrekra nnoɔma no.
However, he said, large volume importers, in their attempt to avoid associated costs that came with the affixing, often sent their products to the facilities for stamping, a situation which resulted in congestion and delays.	Bio, ɔde toaa so sɛ, wɔn a wɔkra nnoɔma dodoɔ no mpɛ sɛ wɔbɔ ka foforɔ biara bio nti wɔde wɔn nnoɔma kɔ Tema beaeɛ hɔ sɛ wɔmfa ahyɛnso no mmɔ wɔn nnoɔma ho, na wei na ɛmaa nnoɔma twetwɛn ase kakra.
Similarly, challenges with the stamps after a change in the service provider also resulted in some delays, he noted.	Sɛ wɔn a wɔma wɔn ahyɛnso no nso nsesa a, ɛma nnoɔma twetwɛn ase.
However, engineers worked on the machines to be able to pick the new stamps.	Engyiniafoɔ siesiee mfidie no maa ɛmaa kwan maa wɔyɛɛ ahyɛnso no ho adwuma.
In his remarks, Mr Asmah called on the GRA to intensify education on policies that were periodically introduced into the trade space.	Ne nsɛnkaeɛ mu no, Mr Asmah de too GRA anim sɛ wɔmma wɔn nhyehyɛeɛ no ho dawubɔ nkɔ n’anim.

The Institute of Energy Security (IES) has said prices of fuel will appreciate marginally at the pumps. A statement issued by IES indicated that the price of fuel on the local market increased within the window under review.	Institute of Energy Security (IES) kyerɛ sɛ fango boɔ bɛkɔ soro kakra. IES asɛm a wɔde too dwa yi kyerɛ sɛ wɔbɛtoto fango boɔ wɔ dwaman so.
Within the first pricing window of June 2021, majority of the oil marketing companies (OMCs) increased their prices of petroleum products by 3% at the pump. Based on this increase, the current national average price of fuel per litre at the pump is pegged at GHS5.97 for both gasoline and gasoil.

For the window under assessment, international benchmark Brent crude price averaged $73.98 per barrel, representing a 4.05% increase from the previous window's average price of $71.10 per barrel.

This window’s increase in price has been largely in response to the rise in COVID-19 cases propelled by the Delta variant in parts of Europe and amid warnings of a dense outbreak in the United States.	ɛnam sɛ wɔn a wɔanya COVID-19 Europe akɔ soro, na yareɛ no ate atese wɔ United States nti na ama fango boɔ a akɔ soro.
For the first time in two years, the price of Brent reached the $75-mark at the end of the pricing window. The global crude demand is rebounding as the summer driving season begins and economies reopen from restrictions in mobility.

This is particularly the case, as road and airline travel continue to increase.	Sɛnti ne sɛ seisei deɛ wɔn a wɔtena kaa mu ne wiemhyɛn mu tu kwan no adɔɔso.
The increase in Brent crude prices has also been attributed to the tightening of the physical crude supply in parts of Europe, Asia and the Middle East, as a result of the dynamics in spread between the regional benchmarks within the period.

This is also not too good, as it would not allow proper investigations to be undertaken.	Wei nso nyɛ ara ne sa ɛsiane sɛ ɛmma nhwehwɛmu mapa a ɛtwa sɛ ɛkɔ so no nkɔ so.
Looking at the official government responses to the “Fix The Country”, agitation, I doubt whether this killing may be sanctioned by the state, even though I am also very much aware that, in our kind of nauseating politics, everything may be possible, including turning a man into a woman and vice versa.	Sɛ yɛhwɛ aban no awoyie fa “fix the ɔountry” nsɛnsɛm no ho a, mennyɛ nni sɛ aban no nim saa wuo yi ho bi, mpo sɛ m’ani tua pa ara sɛdeɛ amanyɛsɛm ayɛ abofono asi afa no, biribiara tumi si.

Government met the agitators to try and calm them down.	Aban no hyiaa wɔn a wɔreyɛ ɔyɛkyerɛ no sɛ nka ɔbɛma wɔn akoma aba fam.
Later, the agitations compelled, at least, two pressers to explain what government is doing to fix the country.	Akyire no, ɔyɛkyerɛ no hyɛɛ dawubɔkuo mmienu no so maa wɔbɛkaa deɛ aban no reyɛ de asiesie ɔman no ho asɛm.
But of course, there are the hawks within the regime, who demonstrated intolerance by calling the bluff of the agitators and asking them to first fix themselves.	Na mmom yɛwɔ nkorɔfoɔ wɔ aban no mu a wɔne wɔn a wɔreyɛ ɔyɛkyerɛ no nyɛ adwene a wɔakyerɛ wɔn nso adwene sɛ wɔn a wɔreyɛ ɔyɛkyerɛ no nso nna suban pa adi.
Then, we have our Police Service, that typically tried to frustrate the intentions of the agitators to demonstrate, using very nonsensical explanations of Covid as basis, when they could not prevent or disperse the mammoth crowd at Sir John’s funeral.

These things make any attempt to link the state to abuses, including murder of an agitator, easy and plausible, even though skepticisms can be entertained because of the absence of watertight evidence.

We must also know, and not be oblivious of the fact that sometimes, our nasty and very dirty politics may push individuals outside government, to carry out such abuses, just for the purposes of deepening agitations and making governments unpopular.	ɛtwa sɛ yɛhunu no biom sɛ, ɛnni kwan sɛ yɛbu yɛn ani gu so sɛ amanyɔsɛm tantan a ɛrekɔ so no nso bɛtumi ama ankorɛankorɛ a wɔnni aban mu no nso bɛtumi ahyɛ nkorɔfoɔ kutupa ama wɔadi nsɛmmɔne anaa wɔde agu aban no anim ase.

The point is, the kind of unbridled hawkish-intolerance exhibited by some elements within regimes and the childish manner with which our security agencies act in dealing with demonstrators, constitute a severe blot on the maturation of our democratization process.

Government may want to fire some security heads to send a certain signal that would compel and elicit highly professional conduct of our security agencies when it comes to crowd management and dealing with demonstrators. Government may also want to send top security brass to school again for them to be socialized in the dogmas of the kind of relational competence they need, to talk agitators out of demonstration, if need be, rather than the very cheap and democratically infantile way of quickly running to court, to seek injunction.

There is no problem with the Chief Justice, Justice Kwasi Anin Yeboah filing a disciplinary complaint against legal practitioner and Member of Parliament for Bolgatanga East, Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine at the General Legal Council (GLC).

According to private legal practitioner and former Member of Parliament for Zebilla, Mr John Ndebugre, the arguments being made by the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and other people against the complaint are issues, which should be dealt with when Dr Ayine appears before the Disciplinary Committee of the General Legal Council (GLC).

"""I think he [Chief Justice] was the proper person to initiate a complaint because the statement that Dr Ayine made which resulted in this complaint was that, in summary, his confidence in the independence of the judiciary has been shaken somehow by the manner in which the presidential election petition was handled or determined."""	“Megye di sɛ na ɔtemmuafo panin paa ne nnipa a ɛwɔ sɛ ɔhyɛ kwaadu yi ase ɛfiri sɛ asɛm a Dr Ayine de too dwa maa kwaadubɔ yi baeɛ no mmuabɔ nyinaa ne sɛ, ɛnam sɛdeɛ ɔmampanin abatoɔ no kɔɔ so nti, ɔnni awerɛhyɛmu wɔ aban mmara adwuma mu.”
The Chief Justice has reported lawyer Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine to the Disciplinary Committee of the GLC for statements he allegedly made during a panel discussion on Presidential Election Petitions and their impact on Africa's Democracy.	ɛnam nsɛm a Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine kaeɛ berɛ a na wɔretwetwe nkɔmmɔ fa Presidential election Petition ne ɛso nsunsuansoɔ a anya wɔ Abibiman kabimamenkabi amammuo so, ɔtemmuafoɔ panin paa de Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine akɔ GLɔ Asotee Kɔmitee anim.
Dr. Ayine has been accused of questioning the independence of the Judiciary due to the manner the Supreme Court adjudicated the 2020 presidential election petition.

The petition says Dr. Ayine’s basis for his assertion during the discussion is the Supreme Court's failure to apply the rules of procedure as well as the consistent and continuous dismissal of the petitioner's applications or reliefs.

"“These comments are made against the backdrop of the Supreme Court discharging Dr. Ayine on a charge of contempt for similar comments made against members of the Supreme Court during the Election Petition hearing. Dr. Ayine apologized profusely when he appeared before the Court on the Contempt charge and admitted to having made comments which were unbecoming of a Lawyer of his standing and a former Deputy Attorney-General."""	“Dr Ayine kaa nsɛm bi sei faa kɔɔto peemu no ho mmerɛ bi atwa mu ɛfa abatoɔ pɛtihyin no ho maa kɔɔto peemu de kɔntɛmɛt kwaadu bɔɔ no.

Dr. Ayine, in his eleven-paged response to the CJ's complaint, is insisting that his comments did not attack the reputation of the justices who sat on the election petition case.

He insists that his comments were in good faith.	ɔsii so dua sɛ, wanka asɛm no wɔ kwan bɔne so.
“As I have stated in this response, as a lawyer, I have a special responsibility to engage in criticism of the work of the judiciary. By reason of my training and experience, I am better placed than most of my fellow citizens to point out deficiencies in judgments and in the performance by the judiciary of its core constitutional mandate.”	“Sɛdeɛ mede too dwa wɔ me mmuaeɛ mu no, ɛyɛ m’asɛdeɛ sɛ mɛbɔ aban mmara adwumakuo dwumadie no akyi. ɛnam nteteeɛ a mafa mu ne suahunu a mewɔ nti, mɛtumi akyerɛ m’adwene afa nnoɔma a ɛnkɔ yie wɔ aban mmara adwumakuo no dwumadie ho asene Ghanafoɔ no fa bi.”
He further posited that his comments were within the confines of fair and temperate speech.	ɔsan nso de kaa ho sɛ, ne nsɛm a ɔkaeɛ no kwan so ara no no.
The main opposition political party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) at a press conference in Accra on Monday asked the Chief Justice to withdraw his disciplinary complaint against Dr Ayine.

Disagreeing with positions that the Chief Justice should withdraw the complaint and that he has no locus to file such a complaint, Mr Ndebugre said Dr Ayine was not talking about an individual member of the panel or the members of the panel who were just seven. He wasn't talking about combination of them. He talked about the whole judiciary and the Chief Justice is the head of the judiciary and therefore he was the proper person to lay the complaint.	Mr Ndebugre kyerɛ sɛ ɔne wɔn a wɔse ɔtemmuafoɔ panin paa ntwe ne kwaadu a ɔde abɔ Dr Ayine nsan no nyɛ adwene. ɔkyerɛ sɛ, Dr Ayine asɛm no ɔkaeɛ no ankɔ amma ɔtemmuafoɔ no mu baako anaa atemmuafoɔ mpaninfoɔ nson a wɔdii asɛm no.

"Speaking in a radio interview monitored by Graphic Online on Accra based Citi FM on Tuesday evening (June 22, 2021), Mr Ndebugre said: ""I think that there is no problem about the Chief Justice laying the complaint."""	ɔne Citi FM a wɔwɔ Accra ntwetwe nkɔmmɔ no Benada anwummerɛ (Kotonomma da a ɛtɔ so aduonu mmienu wɔ 2021 muɔ, Mr Ndebugre kaa sɛ, “megye di sɛ mfomsoɔ biara nni ho sɛ ɔtemmuafoɔ panin paa de kwaadu bɛbɔ no.”
Comparing that to what happened in 1996 - the Republic against Mensah Bonsu, Stephen Quarcoo and Tommy Thompson - in that case Mensah Bonsu attacked an individual judge, Justice Abban and therefore he made the complaint and then the Attorney-General took it up from there and prosecuted the matter on behalf of the judiciary or the court.	ɔde deɛ ɛsii 1996 reyɛ mfatoho no – ɔman no de kwaadu bɔɔ Mensah Bonsu, Stephen Quarɔoo ne Tommy Thompson a wɔkyerɛ sɛ Mensah Bonsu akasa atia Justice Aban nti wɔbɔɔ no kwaadu, ɛnna aban lɔya panin gyinaa aban mmara adwuma no anan mu wɔ kɔɔto.
No problem about CJ filing complaint	ɔtemmuafoɔ panin paa no mfom mmara sɛ ɔde kwaadu bɛbɔ no.
"""So I think that there is no problem about the Chief Justice laying the complaint."	“Nti medwene sɛ mfomsoɔ biara nni ho sɛ ɔtemmuafoɔ panin paa de kwaadu bɛbɔ no.”
The other matter is that, Dominic Ayine was Deputy Attorney-General, and he and his boss at that time took people to the criminal court, proceeding to the civil court... so if the Attorney-General approves the prosecution of a person, can somebody say that no, the person was expressing freedom of speech... therefore he should not be sent to court.

No, you are to go to the court and make your case, and state your case, and say that you were not guilty of the offence charged.	Daabi. ɛwɔ sɛ wokɔ kɔɔto kɔka w’asɛm sɛ wonni fo wɔ kwaadu a wɔde abɔ wo no ho.
So in the same measure, the Chief Justice thinks that the statement was untoward so far as the independence of the judiciary is concerned.	Saa ara nso na ɔtemmuafoɔ panin paa nso kyerɛ sɛ n’asɛm no agu aban mmara adwuma no anim ase.
"So you go there, all those arguments that are being bandied about now, both by the NDC and Dr Ayine himself are matters that should be at the Disciplinary Committee,"" Mr Ndebugre added."	Mr Ndebugre de kaa ho sɛ, “Nti wo deɛ kɔ. ɛwɔ sɛ wɔtena asɛm a NDC ne Dr Ayine no ankasa reka yi so wɔ Asotwee Kɔmitee no so.”
Insisting that he does not want to discuss the merits, he maintained that there are two forms, it is like contempt, whiles the matter is still pending, which is you are interfering with the administration of justice if you make prejudicial statements whiles the case is still pending, then after the judgment has been given and you make statements that scandalise the courts, you can be pursued for that.	ɔkyerɛ sɛ nnoɔma mmienu na ɛwɔ ha, ɛte sɛ kɔntɛmɛt, sɛ woreka asɛm no wɔ kɔɔto na wode nsɛm bi a ɛgu aban mmara adwuma no ho fi to dwa, anaasɛ wɔde atemmuo no ato dwa na woaka asɛm fi bi afa ho no, wɔbɛtumi de wɔn agyina mmara anim ɛnam saa deɛ wei ho.
"If you lose a case in court, you can say that you don't agree, ""but to say that... I say that I don't want to discuss the merits, all I'm doing now is that I don't agree with the position that because in the view of the political party, he [Dr Ayine] was expressing his right to free expression and therefore the matter should not be pursued.

"""The point is that you must go to the Disciplinary Committee and state there that you were exercising your right to free expression, but you cannot say that the Chief Justice cannot make a complaint, he is the head of the judiciary, and you say your confidence in the judiciary has been dampened because of the way the case was handled. So he should go there [GLC], and point out those aspects of the handling of the case that led him to the conclusion that the judiciary in Ghana is not independent."""	“Asɛm no nyinaa ne sɛ, ɛwɔ sɛ wokɔ Asotwee Kɔmitee no anim na wokɔ ka sɛ na worekyerɛ w’adwene, na mmom sɛ woka sɛ ɔtemmuafoɔ panin paa a ɛda aban mmara adwuma no ano nni ho kwan sɛ ɔde kwaadu bɛbɔ wo, na wonnye sɛdeɛ aban mmara adwuma no dii asɛm no faeɛ no ntom.

"Asked about the notion that the Chief Justice chairs the GLC and therefore the Disciplinary Committee, is a sub-committee of his court and therefore he was sending Ayine to his own ""court"" to be tried, Mr Ndebugre replied, ""are you saying that those who constitute the Disciplinary Committee are robots, and that they are going to take instructions from the Chief Justice. When you do these things, you don't help the development of our democracy. Freedom of speech does not mean that you can just say whatever you like."""

"""I'm not saying that the Chief Justice is right or wrong."	“Menkaa sɛ deɛ ɔtemmuafoɔ panin paa no yɛɛ no yɛ anaa nyɛ.”
All I'm saying is that the Chief Justice has made a complaint, as far as I am concerned he is the right person to make the complaint because the statement was against the judiciary, the independence of the judiciary, and he is the head of the judiciary and he has to come forward with a complaint.

“We at Transeco Mining and Minerals Company have decided to ensure that children in communities where we operate are exposed to the best of teaching and learning environments at the lower levels of education.

I’m excited to be back at Ampapatia to commission this school. We all know how important education is to the growth of individuals and the country. In order to have brilliant students at higher levels of education, they must first have a strong foundation that is why we have built this Kindergarten”, he said.	ɔkaa sɛ, “ɛyɛ me dɛ sɛ maba Ampapatia na merebɛbue saa sukuu yi ano.

Mr. Amarh said the school is also an appreciation to the chiefs and people of Ampapatia who have maintained a healthy relationship with the company since they started their operations in the community.

Contrary to rumors and wild speculations that government has placed a ban on mining activities in the country, Mr. Amarh debunked the rumours and described it as not just inaccurate but false.	Mr Amarh de too dwa sɛ ɛnyɛ nokorɛ sɛ aban no de taaboɔ ato maenen so wɔ ɔman no mu.
According to him, government has rather introduced new measures, policies and programmes aimed at making small scale mining productive and not destructive.	ɔkyerɛ sɛ aban no mmom de nhyehyɛeɛ mapa aba sɛdeɛ maenen bɛtu mpɔn, na nyɛ sɛ ɔbɛgu no.
“Government has not banned activities of miners but rather categorized areas close to water bodies and forest reserves as red zones where no individual or company should mine. So what government is saying is that small scale miners should move away from the red zones. So anyone who does contrary to the directive by government will be dealt with by the laws of the country”, Mr. Amarh said.	Mr Amarh kaa sɛ, “Aban mfaa taaboɔ ntoo maenen na mmom wɔkyerɛ beaeɛ ahodoɔ a ɛbɛn nsuo ne kwaeɛ no mu baabi a ɛnni kwan sɛ obiara kɔyɛ maenen dwumadie biara wɔ hɔ. Nti obiara a ɔbɛbu aban nhyehyɛeɛ yi so no, mmara ne no bɛdi.”
He therefore advised small scale miners to go work but ensure that they mine at designated areas.	ɔtuu wɔn a wɔyɛ maenen adwuma no fo sɛ, wɔkɔtu maenen no na mmom wɔnyɛ no beaeɛ a wɔahyɛ wɔn no no.
Mr. Amarh who also doubles as the General Secretary of the Ghana National Association of Small Scale Miners (GNASSM) admonished members of the group to impact positively on communities where they have concessions.

He said although many small scale miners are already doing that, there remains more to be done.	ɔkyerɛɛ sɛ, maenenfoɔ no bi rebɔ wɔn ho mmɔden nso wɔbɛtumi ayɛ asene saa.
“Our sector employs a lot of people in communities where we operate. We must therefore work assiduously to leave a footprint. I know a lot of our members who have built schools and others have helped communities get electricity. We must push those stories out there to change the narrative that small scale miners only destroy’, he advised.	ɔtoo fo sɛ, “Yɛn adwumakuo yi fa nnipa bebree wɔ mpɔtam ahodoɔ a yɛyɛ yɛn nnwuma no adwuma. ɛwɔ sɛ yɛyɛ adwumaden gya biribi papa to hɔ.

During a courtesy by the institute on the management of BoG, the President of IoD-Gh, Mr Rockson Kwesi Dogbegah, eulogised the Governor of the central bank, Dr Ernest Addison, for providing transformational leadership in reforming the financial services sector.

He said the effort by BoG led by Dr Addison had led to a vibrant and resilient banking sector.	ɔkyerɛ sɛ BoG a Dr Addison da ano no aboa ma sikakorabea a ɛwɔ ɔman no mu ntotoeɛ atu mpɔn.
A statement from the institute said the visit was to commend the bank for its significant role in promoting the culture of good corporate governance in Ghana and to seek mutually beneficial relationships between BoG and the institute.

Speaking on the strategic projects of the IoD-Gh, Mr Dogbegah said the IoD-Gh is developing a charter aimed at setting standards for the practice of corporate governance in Ghana.	ɔrekasa afa nhyehyɛeɛ a IoD-Gh de agu akwan mu no, Mr Dogbegah kyerɛ sɛ IoD-Gh de nhyehyɛeɛ regu akwan mu sɛdeɛ ɛbɛyɛ nnwumakuo mu amammuo bɛtu mpɔn wɔ ɔman no mu.
He indicated that the development of a national governance code was another key strategic project to be undertaken by the institute.	ɔkyerɛ sɛ ɔman mu amammuo kɔɔdo nso yɛ nhyehyɛeɛ baako a wɔde regu akwan mu.
He disclosed that the institute had established the ongoing annual corporate governance excellence awards as part of its strategic efforts to celebrate the achievements of outstanding individual personalities and corporate organisations that have represented excellence in leadership and corporate governance and have made significant contributions to the socioeconomic development of Ghana.	ɔdaa no adi sɛ afe biara no, wɔbɛbɔ nnipa ahodoɔ ne nnwumakuo a wɔn adwuma sɔ ani no wɔ nnwumakuo amammuo mu na wɔaboa ama mpontuo aba ɔman no mu aba so.
He added that the Institute, working in collaboration with key stakeholders, had championed the formation of the Ghana Association of Integrated Thinking and Reporting aimed at stimulating a strategic and sustainable way of value creation and reporting by organisations.	ɔde kaa ho sɛ adwumakuo ne ne nnwumakuo ahodoɔ aka wɔn ho abɔm ate Ghana associationof Integrated Thinking and Reporting a ɛbɛboa ama nnwumakuo aba nyam.
BoG Governor stated that corporate governance played an important role in the financial sector.	Panin paa ɔda BoG ano de too dwa sɛ nnwumakuo amammuo di akotene yie wɔ sikasɛm nnwumakuo mu.
According to him, corporate governance breaches, overbearing shareholder behaviour and related-party transactional breaches as some of the factors that led to the failure of some banks in the financial sector and their consequent resolution.	ɔkyerɛ sɛ mmara a wɔbu so wɔn nnwumakuo amammuo mu, adwumayɛfoɔ no suban ne deɛ ɛkeka ho nyinaa na ɛmmoa ma sikakorabea ahodoɔ mfa wɔn ntoma pa mfira.
He reiterated the need for the Ghanaian society to uphold good corporate governance practices and pledged the bank’s support for the work of the institute, especially as events in the banking sector have a rippling effect on the Ghanaian economic sector.	ɔde kaa ho sɛ, Ghanafoɔ mmoa na nnwumakuo amammuo mapa nkɔ so, na ɔde too dwa sɛ BoG nso bɛboa ama nnwumakuo no dwumadie atu mpɔn ɛsiane sɛ sikakorabea ahodoɔ no dwumadie nya nsunsuansoɔ wɔ ɔman no sikasɛm so.

As I have already mentioned, Arsenal do not intend to sack Mikel Arteta and the club management will back him to turn the Gunners around next season.

Serious questions are being asked about the manager’s ability and even in his own dressing room players are looking at him and wondering if he is the right man for the job.

At 39 years-of-age Arteta has a reputation, built alongside Pep Guardiola, as a brilliant coach.	Arteta ne Pep Guardiola yɛɛ adwuma gyee din sɛ kookyi a ɔbɔ ne ho mmɔden berɛ na wadi mfeɛ aduasa nkron.
However, after seventeen months in charge the fortunes of Arsenal have not progressed and many would argue that the team performances are inferior to those of Unai Emery, the man he replaced and who knocked him out of the Europa League.

Arteta captained Arsenal and was welcomed by the fans as their new champion but they are getting restless and agitated as they watch Chelsea and Tottenham move further ahead.

De Gea won’t accept being No2	De Gea nnye ntom sɛ ɔbɛyɛ abadiakyire.
Despite Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea having a contract until 2023 his agents are testing the waters to see which clubs would be interested in signing him.

I am sure the coach is right however if De Gea doesn’t regain recognition for the No1 stitched onto the back of his shirt and is left on the bench in crucial games, I am reliably informed he will move out of Old Trafford.

Solskjaer is turning United into winners again	Solskɛaer reboa ama United afa ne ntoma pa afira.
Manchester United might have big problems with the fans actively showing aggression towards the owners but inside the club there is a new belief, a new harmony and renewed confidence that they can achieve.

The man responsible is Ole Gunner Solskjaer and after speaking with many United staff and supporters this week, everyone recognises that it is time to praise the manager for achieving so much in the last eighteen months.

Cavani has confirmed that he is staying for another season and it is mainly his belief in Solskjaer which has persuaded him.	ɔavani de ato dwa sɛ ɔbɛtena bɔɔlobɔ kuo no mu afe baako aka ho na gyidie a ɔwɔ wɔ Solskɛaer mu na ama watena bɔɔlobɔ kuo no mu.
Paul Pogba looks settled and happy and his relationship with the manager is at an all-time high.	Biribiara rekɔ yie ma Paul Pogba na n’ani nso gye. ɔne manigya no ayɔnkofa no nso yɛ.

There is one thing to thank out-going Executive Vice-Chairman Ed Woodward for and that is allowing Solskjaer time to succeed in the job, survive the rough patches and turn his players into winners.

I noticed a significant silence during the match against Leeds at the weekend.	Manhunu ne mmɔdemmɔ no so berɛ na wɔne Leeds United resi akan nnawɔtwe yi awieeɛ.
Harry Kane usually runs as much, if not more, than any other player and constantly barks out orders and instructions to other players to play more effectively.

Against Leeds he was very quiet and more so than I think I have ever seen him.	Wɔne Leeds resi akan no, na ɔyɛ dinn a menhunuu no saa bi da.

Chinhoyi City Council says it is ready to comply with the High Court's ruling on Monday that the council should rebuild buildings that it demolished in the city.	ɔhinhoyi CityCouncil kyerɛ sɛ wɔayɛ ahoboa sɛ wɔbɛdi deɛ kɔɔto de too dwa Dwoada sɛ kansere no nsisi adan a wɔabubu agu wɔn kurom hɔ no.
Speaking at a meeting with traders who had their buildings demolished by the Chinhoyi council, the council's secretary, Abel Gotora, said they would abide by the court's order for the council to build commercial buildings which had been demolished by some traders.

But Mr Gotora said the council would not rebuild all the buildings it had demolished, but would only build the buildings that the high court had ordered for the six people who took the council to court.

One of the six, Emmanuel Gwaru, said he accepted the court ruling with great joy as the government had told the councils to clean up the area only, not demolish buildings.

Mr Gwaru said one of his biggest grievances was that he was paying money for the council to build better commercial facilities. Gadzema Councilor Patricia Chibaya said she was pleased with the court's decision as she was in a difficult situation because, on the other hand, as a councilor, she had to comply with a letter from provincial minister July Moyo to clean up the cities, but at the same time. they also sympathize with the people who live by the trade whose markets have been destroyed.

Following the Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday as to who should lead the MDC party since the death of Morgan Tsvangirai, many people want to know who the real owner of the Richard Morgan Tsvangirai House or Harvest House is.

But the issue of who enters the party's headquarters is a bit difficult as there are two people guarding the building, namely Ian Makone and Reverend Tim Neil, a former head of the Church of the Province of Central Africa or CPCA.

Experts say Nelson Chamisa's MDC has gone to court after Ms Khupe's faction had written letters to banks seeking to remove Chamisa's members from the list of people who were required to sign statements to withdraw money from the party's Steward Bank.

But Morgen Komichi, who has been claiming to be the party's chairman following a Supreme Court ruling that ruled that Chamisa had not complied with his party's constitution to become MDC leader, said he would take steps to get the money as he was the party's official leader.

But the head of the Community Working Group on Health, Mr Itai Rusike, said the government should address the problem urgently and provide doctors with money to prevent them from picking ants by mouth.

Some Zimbabweans in South Africa have protested at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, where Deputy President Constantino Chiwenga is being treated, demanding that Chiwenga return to a local hospital for treatment.

Mr Chiwenga was reportedly rushed out of the country over the weekend for medical treatment in South Africa, although Studio 7 could not find any evidence that he was in South Africa's largest hospital.

Media Minister Monica Mutsvangwa and Information Secretary Nick Mangwana declined to comment on the matter on Sunday when contacted by VOA's Studio 7 for Zimbabwe, urging them to arrest George Charamba.

Another Zimbabwean, Carlos Chimbi, who lives in Cape Town, joined other Zimbabweans in the protest.	Zimbabweni foforɔ a wɔfrɛ no ɔarlos ɔhimbi a ɔte ɔape Town kɔkaa Zimbabwefoɔ a wɔreyɛ ɔyɛkyerɛ no ho.
"Chimbi said he was ""deeply saddened"" that the vice president had violated the rights of people with disabilities in the country as he knew he would seek medical treatment abroad if he became ill."	ɔhimbi de too dwa sɛ ɔyɛ no awerɛho sɛ ɔmampanin abadiakyire atiatia nnipa a wɔadi dɛm fahodie so wɔ ɔman no mu a ɔnim sɛ sɛ ɔyare a, ɔbɛkɔ akɔgye ayarehwɛ wɔ amannɔne.
He said he was happy to be able to deliver his message to the hospital as the head of the hospital had asked to speak to him, although he did not say whether Mr Chiwenga was at the hospital or not.	ɔkaa sɛ n’ani agye sɛ watumi aka saa nsɛm yi akyerɛ ayaresabea no wɔ mmerɛ a ɔpanin a ɔhwɛ ayaresabea no so kaa sɛ ɔne no mmɛkasa nanso wanka sɛ Owura ɔhiwenga wɔ ayaresabea hɔ anaasɛ ɔnni hɔ.
Chimbi said the head of the hospital had told him that the law did not allow him to talk about patients who would be at the hospital if they were not at the hospital.	ɔhimbi de too dwa sɛ ɔpanin a ɔhwɛ asopiti no so ka kyerɛɛ no sɛ mmara mma ho kwan sɛ ɔbɛkasa afa ayarefoɔ a wɔbɛba ayaresabea wɔ mmerɛ a wɔnni ayaresabea hɔ.
Chiwenga angered the people last year when doctors went on strike, saying they were not skilled workers but ordinary workers, and that the government had not taken steps to address the problems in hospitals that are causing people to lack proper treatment.

Speaking after a meeting of the party's Standing Committee in Harare, MDC deputy spokesman Luke Tamborinyoka said police had banned the rally and said they were busy with the reopening of schools.	ɔreka berɛ wɔn kɔmitee nhyiamu baa awieeɛ wɔ Harare no, MDɔ kasamafoɔ abadiakyire Luke Tamborinyoka kaa sɛ apolisifoɔ de taaboɔ ato wɔn nhyiamu kɛseɛ no so na wɔse wɔn ani wɔ sukuu a ɛrebue no ho.

He said it was clear that the police were trying to attack the party's supporters as they had done when the party planned to protest in all the cities and towns in the country.	ɔde too dwa sɛ ɛda adi pefee sɛ apolisifoɔ no pɛ sɛ wɔne wɔn akyitaafoɔ no ham so`te sɛ sɛdeɛ wɔyɛeɛ berɛ a amanyɔkuo no yɛɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ɔyɛkyerɛ wɔn kuro a ɛwɔ ɔman no nyinaa mu.
He said the conference, which had the theme of Agenda 2020, was to be held at Ms Musodzi Hall in Mbare and would be held on Tuesday next week at a venue to be announced later.	ɔde too dwa sɛ nhyiamu a na wɔato ne din “Agenda 2020” a na ɛwɔ sɛ ɛkɔ so Ms Musodzi Hall wɔ Mbare no bɛba so Benada wɔ nnawɔtwe a ɛdi yɛn anim no. ɔde beaeɛ a nhyiamu no bɛkɔ so bɛto dwa akyire.

Many elephants and other animals are dying of starvation and water in the Hwange National Park, prompting the government to intensify its efforts to reduce the number of elephants.

During a visit to Studio7 in the Hwange National Park area, we saw the bodies of many elephants who have died of malnutrition caused by drought in some areas this year.	Yɛkɔɔ Studio 7 a ɛwɔ Hwamge National Park no, yɛhunuu asono bebree a ɛkɔm ne nsukɔm akum wɔn.
Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) spokesperson Tinashe Farawo told Studio7 that 85 elephants have died since September and more than 200 have died this year due to starvation.	Tinashe Farawo a ɔyɛ kasamafoɔ ma Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) ɛkaa wɔ Studio 7 kasafidie so sɛ, firi ɛbɔ bosome no mu reba no, asono adwuowɔtwe-num na awu ɛnna mmoadoma ɛyɛ ahannu na ɛkɔm akum wɔn wɔ afe yi mu.
The Pharaohs also said that in addition to the famine, one of the main causes of death is the shortage of food and water, which has led to a reduction in the number of elephants and other animals.	Faraofoɔ no nso de kaa ho sɛ, yɛyi ɛkɔm no si nkyɛn a, aduane ne nsuo a ɛkɔɔ atwee nso ama asono ne mmoadoma pii ahwere wɔn nkwa.
When eating, one elephant is said to need more than 200 pounds [500 kg] of food and to require more than two gallons [200 L] of water.	Sɛ ɔsono baako redidi a, ɛbɛhia aduane a emu duru bɛyɛ 200 pawds ɛ500 kgɔ ne nsuo bɛyɛ galɔn mmienu (200 L) ne deɛ ɛboro saa.
But now ZimParks estimates that there are more than 45,000 elephants in the area.	Nnɛ yi, ZimParks kyerɛ sɛ wɔwɔ asono bɛyɛ 45,000 wɔ beaeɛ hɔ.
Some animal rights activists say the figures provided by ZimParks are false and say they are doing this as a way of getting support to be able to sell elephants.	Nkroɔfoɔ a wɔhwɛ mmoa yiedie so kyerɛ sɛ, nɔɔma a ZimParks de ato dwa no nyɛ nokorɛ, na wɔreyɛ saa sɛdeɛ wɔbɛyɛ kwan atɔtɔn asono no.

According to Chisaira, one of the main causes of hunger for animals in the Hwange National Park is the government's decision to allow people to do things such as mining, which they say should not be done in the area.	ɔhisaira se, aban no agyinatuo sɛ wɔbɛma wɔatu fam agudeɛ wɔ beaeɛ hɔ aa wɔde ato dwa sɛ biribi saa nkɔ so wɔ hɔ no, na ɛma ɛkɔm de mmoa a ɛwɔ Hwange National Park hɔ.
But Mr. Farawo said he was concerned about the views of animal rights activists who said they did not want to accept the fact that elephants and other animals are increasing due to the good work of his department, adding that the department is open and its doors open to all who want to know the situation in zoos.	Nanso Owura Farawo de too dwa sɛ, wɔn a wɔhwɛ mmoa yiedie adwenkyerɛ a wɔde too dwa sɛ wɔne wɔn nnye adwene sɛ asono ne mmoadoma a wɔwɔ hɔ no akɔ soro ɛnam adwuma pa n’adwumayɛfoɔ no reyɛ no ho ns ɛhia no. ɛde toaa so sɛ wɔbɛtumi aba beaeɛ a mmoa no wɔ no abɛhwɛ wɔn ani so.
Zimbabwe and other northern African countries, including Botswana, say they want the International Convention on the Trade in Endagered to allow them to sell their elephants as the number of animals has increased, which has led to a number of problems, including human and animal poaching.

Mr Sanders said Mr Bloomberg was a well-known figure in New York mayor's decision to suspend and search for black people, as well as to Latinos, who were unfairly doing so. He said such a move could not get more people to vote for Mr. Trump's removal in November.

The state-owned petrol company Petrotrade says if the government continues to set prices for the purchase and sale of motor fuel, the problem of fuel shortages will not go away.	Aban pɛtro dwumakuo, Petrotrade se sɛ aban no kɔso kyerɛ sɛdeɛ wɔntɔ anaa wɔtɔ fango a, ɛnneɛ fango a ɛho akɔ atwee no nkɔ da.
Responding to a parliamentary proposal on fuel prices, former Petrotrade chief executive Godfrey Ncube said this was only possible if businesses were given the opportunity to buy fuel and sell at their own expense.	ɔde n’anodisɛm fa mmarahyɛbadwafie fango boɔ nhyehyɛeɛ reto dwa no, Petrotrade krakye panin dadaa Godfrey Nɔube de too dwa sɛ sɛ wɔma adwumakuo akwannya ma wɔtɔ anaa wɔtɔn fango sɛdeɛ wɔn ara pɛ a, wei bɛyɛ yie.
Mr Ncube acknowledged that doing so would raise prices but said it was the only way out of the country's long-running oil crisis.	Owura Nɔube gye too mu sɛ, wei bɛma boɔ akɔ soro nanso ɛno ara ne kwan a ɔman no bɛtumi asi ɔhaw no ano.

Mr Ncube pointed out the shortage of fuel purchased by government assistance with the example he gave, saying that in the first six months last year, they sold 50 million liters, but in the same period this year they sold only 36 million liters.

Asked whether the plan to use the Smart Card to buy fuel was mentioned by the governor of the central bank, John Mangudya, when he said the card would show the amount of fuel consumed by each car in the garage used to buy the fuel, Ms Magombo said the plan was reversed by the COVID-19 scandal. there was a need to buy in China.

Ms Magombo said she could not say when the plan would be successful, although Mr Mangudya told the committee last month that he hoped by the end of June they would try to use the card to see if it worked as intended.

This has angered a parliamentary committee that has said the fire department is failing to do its job as Ms Magombo also said she had heard from members of the committee today that many petrol stations in the country were selling for US dollars or foreign currency coupons.

For many athletes, the Christmas holiday season is a time to be with family and friends, while others take this opportunity to do different things. But this year at a time when some are visiting family and friends after a year without seeing each other, FC Platinum coach Lizwe Sweswe and his team are not getting the chance as they are in Cairo, Egypt, in their match against Al Ahly in the Caf Champions League.

Sweswe says they will be at work working in the hope that Christmas will give them the good fortune to win after being beaten in both games. Another football coach, Darlington Dodo of Caps United, says after failing to win the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League trophy, this is the time to make amends where there was no standing. But the head of the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee, Anna Mguni, said they headed to their home to see relatives and friends who had not been seen for a long time. Basketball player, Nyarai Musambudzi, has a similar plan to Ms Mguni's but is heading to Masvingo Triangle coach Taurayi Mangwiro says his workplace is so far away from his family that football has now stopped giving time to his family. This is also the case for former World Cup netball player Ursula Ndlovu, who says he has spent so much time in the camp that he will now be with his family and friends in Bulawayo having fun together. But the chairman of the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association, Ringisai Mapondera, says there is nothing better than a volleyball game at Christmas. Mapondera said he would be gathering with family and friends at his home in Harare to play the game in celebration of this time. There are others like Mapondera including boxer Charles Manyuchi, who says they are taking this time to prepare hard for their next season in anticipation of a strong harvest next year.

“I am proud and extremely excited to see the NPP and the NDC in Bono East working together peacefully, in resolving the political impasse between them,” he said.	ɔkaa sɛ ɛyɛ me ahohoahoa sɛ NPP ne NDC mpaninfoɔ aka abom a wɔreboa ama mantam no akɔ so
Mr Adu-Gyan said peace created an enabling environment for development to thrive and added that without peace it would be difficult for development to progress in the region.	Mr. Adu-Gyan de toaa so sɛ asomdwoeɛ boa ma nkɔsoɔ ba mpɔtam biara na sɛ asomdwoeɛ nni mantam no mu a mpontuo yɛ den ma wɔn
The regional minister gave the commendation in a statement issued after a forum in Techiman.	Mantam soafoɔ no de nsɛm yi too dwa berɛ Teɔhiman dwumadie no baa awieeɛ no
The forum was attended by representatives of the NPP and the NDC, representatives of traditional authorities, security agencies, the Electoral Commission (EC), the National Commission or Civic Education (NCCE) and civil society organisations (CSOs).	mpaninfoɔ a wɔbaa dwumadie yi ase bi ne NPP ne NDC mpaninfoɔ, traditional authorities ananmusifoɔ, banbɔ nnwumayɛfoɔ, abatoɔ kɔmisa, National Commission or Civic Education (NɔɔEɔ ne ɔivil soɔiety organisations (ɔsosɔ ahodoɔ.
The forum, which was organised by the National Peace Council with sponsorship from the Commonwealth Secretariat, was on the theme: “Countering Post 2020 Election Violence, and Building Consensus for Greater Political Tolerance in Ghana”.

Mr Adu-Gyan said Ghanaians ought to be proud of the country being ranked the second most peaceful in Africa by the Global Peace Index Report 2021, and underlined the importance for the NPP and the NDC to collectively help to preserve and strengthen the prevailing peace in the country.

In a presentation on Electoral Justice, the Executive Secretary of the Bono Regional Peace Council, Alhaji Suallah Abdallah Quandah, said electoral justice played a decisive role in ensuring the stability of the political system in the country.	ɔrekasa wɔ Electoral Justice dwumadie ase, Alhaɛi Suallah Abdallah Quandah a ɔyɛ twerɛtwerɛfoɔ panin ma Bono mantam peace Council de too dwa sɛ ɛnam Electoral Justice so nti na amanyɔsɛm atumi agyina wɔ ɔman no mu
“The role of electoral justice, although not new, has become recognised as a crucial factor in all democracies, whether emerging or established,” it said and explained electoral justice was a prerequisite for preventing political and election violence.	ɔkyerɛɛ sɛ mu sɛ ɛwɔm sɛ Electoral Justice dwumadie nyɛ adefoforɔ bi na mmom sɛ ɔman sɛ ɔman bɛtu mpon wɔ abatoɔ ne amanyɔsɛm mu ɛnni kwan sɛ wɔtoto wɔn dwumadie ase

The MP for Abuakwa South Samuel Atta Akyea has assured Ghanaians a Nana Akufo-Addo-led government will ameliorate their plight when the NPP takes over power from January 7, 2017.

“January 7 will be a new era which is going to bring our prosperity and our freedom, especially economic freedom which Ghanaians are craving. Ghanaians are going to notice that God has saved the country from hardship,” Atta Akyea said during a donation to Asiakwa SOS in the East Akim Municipality in the Eastern region.

Three sisters who slept in their mother’s drinking spot have been found dead at Tarkwa-Nsuta in the Tarkwa-Nsuaem municipality in the Western region.	Wɔahunu anuanom mmiɛnsa a wɔdaa wɔ beaeɛ a wɔn maame tɔn nsa wɔ Tarkwa-Nsuta wɔ Tarkwa-Nsuaem mansini no mu wɔ Apueɛ Mantam no mu sɛ wɔawu
The three died after inhaling fumes from a generator.	Wɔn baasa wuiɛ esiane generator nwusie a wɔtwe kɔɔ wɔn mu no
Chief Inspector George Sekyi of the Tarkwa-Nsuta station office said on December 18, he received a call that three children had died in a drinking spot.	Inspɛkta panin George Sakyi a ɔwɔ Tarkwa-Nsuta station de too dwa sɛ obi frɛɛ wɔn ɔpɛnimaa no sɛ mmɔfra mmiɛnsa bi awu wɔ beaeɛ bi a wɔnom nsa
He said he and his officers rushed to the scene but were told that the deceased Abena Amos, 15, Arabi Dadzi, 13 and Akaba Dadzi, 7, have already been deposited at the Tarkwa Government Hospital morgue awaiting autopsy.	ɔkyerɛ mu a berɛ a ɔne ne ɔfisɛrs no duruu hɔ na wɔde awufoɔ no Abena Amos, , Arabi Dadzi, 13 and Akaba Dadzi, 7  adi kan kɔ Tarkwa aban ayaresabea a wɔretwɛn amannebɔ a ɛfa wɔn wuo no ho
In an interview with Starr News’ Emmanuel Ohene Gyan Mr. Sekyi said the deceased lived with their mother, who operates the ‘Golden City Kitchen’ drinking spot in the Tarkwa Nsuem municipality.	ɔne Starr kaseɛ nsɛntwerɛni Emmanuel Ohene Gyan rekasa no, Mr. Sekyi kyerɛɛ mu sɛ na awufoɔ no ne wɔn maame na ɛte a na maame no na na ɔhwɛ Golden CityKitɔhen so wɔ Tarkwa Nsuem mansini no mu

The station officer said on December 17, there was a power outage as result of a heavy downpour that occurred during the day and because of that Madam Dadzi put a generator in the bar to enable the deceased have access to light as they slept. The mother of the girls later found them dead when she went to the shop the next morning.	ɔfisa no kyerɛ mu a, ɔpɛnimaa da no wɔdumm kaseɛ esiane nsubrane a ɛtɔeɛ da no mu nti.

Flagbearer of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) John Mahama says he will pursue the Chief Executive Officer for Menzgold Nana Appiah Mensah popularly known as NAM 1, to retrieve held up investment of customers if he wins the December polls.

Speaking at Tarkwa-Nsuaem in the Western Region, Mr Mahama wondered why the Akufo-Addo government does not appear to be interested in confiscating the properties of NAM1 but rather venting their anger on customers.	ɔrekasa wɔ Tarkwa-Nsuaem wɔ Apueɛ mantam no, Mr. Mahama de too sɛ ɛyɛ no nwanwa sɛ Akufo Addo no ɛmfa ho sɛ NAM agye ɔmanfoɔ no agyapadeɛ na mmom ɔde n’aniberɛ asi ɔmanfoɔ no so
“What is so special about NAM 1 that Akufo-Addo is shielding him? Why do you unleash the police on innocent customers while NAM 1 walks free,” he fumed.	ɔtoaa so sɛ, ɛdeɛn na ɛwɔ NAM ho a ɛma no yɛ soronko a Akufo Addo rebɔ ne ho ban no?

he Circuit Court in Accra presided over by Her Honour Ellen Asamoah on September 7 adjourned the case in which Chief Executive officer (CEO) of Menzgold Nana Appiah Mensah (NAM1) has been adjourned to October 1, 2020.

The State had previously on June 24, 2020, filed new charges against NAM 1 at the Accra Circuit Court.	Na ɔman no adi kan abɔ NAM soboɔ wɔ Kotonimaa wɔ afe mpem mmienu ne aduonu no mu wɔ Nkran Circuit kɔɔto
Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Sylvester Asare then told the Court that his directives were that he should hold on to the new charges and the plea taking of the accused.

On July 20, ASP Asare told the court that, they were seriously working to advise the court on the matter.	Ayɛwohomɔbɔ no mu no, ASP Asare kakyerɛɛ kɔɔto no wɔretu kɔɔto no fo sɛ wɔntie akwankyerɛ a aba wɔ asɛm no ho no
To this end, he prayed the court for a long adjournment after which they would have been able to advise the court on their intention of prosecution on the matter.	Wɔsrɛɛ kɔɔto no sɛ wɔntu asɛm no nhyɛ da wɔn ne kwaadubɔfoɔ no nkɔyɛ ahoboa wɔ asɛm no ho mmra
He said when the advice is ready, they will issue hearing notice to the accused persons to appear before the court to to do the needful.	ɔkaa sɛ sɛ afotusɛm no ba a wɔbɛma wɔn aso ate na wɔasiesie wɔn a wɔabɔ wɔn kwaadu no ama wɔn aba kɔɔto abɛyɛ nea ɛfata

The accused person NAM 1 was present in court.	NAM a wɔabɔ no kwaadu no daa ne ho adi wɔ kɔɔto
The Circuit Court on July 26, 2019 granted NAM 1 bail in the sum of GH¢ 1 billion cedis with five sureties, three to be justified.	Ayɛwohumɔbɔ da a ɛtɔ so mu wɔ afe mpem mmienu ne du nkron mu no, Nkran Circuit kɔɔto maa NAM bail GHS billion
He had pleaded not guilty to all initial 13 charges levelled against him by the State. The state had since amended its charged sheet which is yet to be moved.	ɔkaa sɛ ɔnni fɔ wɔ soboɔ du mmiɛnsa a aban no de abɔ no no ho. ɛno aban no ayɛ sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nsesaeɛ wɔ soboɔ no mu na wɔahunu kwan a wɔbɛfa so
He is also to report to the police every Wednesday at 10:00 hours.	Afei nso ɛwɔ sɛ ɔde ne ho bɛkyerɛ apolisifoɔ Wukuada nnɔn du biara
He was initially charged with abetment of crime, defrauding by false pretences, carrying on a deposit-taking business without licence, sale of minerals without licence, unlawful deposit-taking, and money laundering.

The surge in the use of Okada for commercial purposes is increasingly becoming worrying.	Okada a wɔde di daadaa dwuma reyɛ ayɛ ɔhaw
The police have also indicated an increase in incidents of crime, accidents, and violations of road traffic regulations involving motorcycles.	Apolisifoɔ nso kyerɛ sɛ korɔno bebree a ɛrekɔ so, akwanhyia ne mmara a wɔnni so wɔ akwantempɔn so nyinaa yɛ motorfoɔ
Without any doubt, the Okada menace is getting out of hand and something drastic needs to be done to inject sanity into its operations.	Akyinninyeɛ nni ho sɛ okada twie a ɛrekɔ so bebrebe no de ɔhaw reba na ɛwɔ sɛ wɔwɔ nhyehyɛeɛ de si ano kwan
We have on countless occasions raised serious concerns about the use of Okada.	Mmerɛ pii na yɛde aka ɔhaw a okada a wɔtwi yi de da
At this moment, the nation is clearly confronted with the challenge of dealing with the usage of motorbikes and tricycles, especially for commercial purposes.	Saa berɛ yi ɔhaw baako a ɔman no rehyia ne sɛdeɛ wɔbɛfa so ate motor ne okada a wɔde di daadaa dwuma no
Parliament in 2012 passed the Road Traffic Regulations, 2012 (L.I. 2180) into law to regulate road transport in the country.	Afe mpem mmienu ne du mmienu mu no, mmarahyɛbadwam de Road Traffiɔ Regulations, 2012 (L.I. 2180 ɔ yɛɛ mmara a ɛbɛhwɛ akɔneabadie mu nsɛm
Among other things, Regulation 128 under sections one to four (Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 2180) outlaws the use of motorbikes popularly referred to as ‘Okada’ and tricycles for commercial purposes except for courier and delivery services. It also directs the licensing authority not to register a motorcycle to carry a fare-paying passenger.	Mmara no baa sɛ ɛnni kwan sɛ wɔde okada ne motor fa ɔmanfoɔ no gye sɛ ebia wɔde di dwuma sɛ ɔourier anaa delivery Services. Afei wɔhyɛɛ DVLA sɛ ɛnni kwan sɛ wɔma motor foɔ no krataa a wɔde di dwuma sɛ wɔde reyɛ adwuma afa ɔmanfoɔ
This legislation, notwithstanding, okada and tricycle (pragya) have taken over the transportation system in many parts of the country.	Okada ne pragya no abunkam afa ɔman yi mu a wɔmfa ho ne mmara a mmarahyɛbadwam no hyɛeɛ no
In the rural communities, the okada and pragya come in handy as the only means of transport to markets, health facilities and other towns, among other places.	Sɛ wokɔ nkuraaseɛ no mu a okada ne pragya no na wɔde kɔ adwa so, asopiti ne mmeammea ahodoɔ
For people in the cities, they are able to beat the heavy traffic by patronizing the bikes.	Wɔn a wɔwɔ kuro kɛse mu no fa okada ne pragya sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wɔnni traffik mu
The bikes also serve as a cheap source of transportation as they are less expensive.	Esiane sɛ ne boɔ yɛ fo nti no dodoɔ no ara pɛ ne fa
They also come in handy because of the absence of an efficient and reliable public transport system.	Sɛ kaa nni a pragya ne okada yi ara na wɔdwane kɔtoa no
However, many people abhor okada and pragya because of the nuisance they create on the roads and most particularly the lack of respect for traffic regulations.	Nanso nnipa pii no ara na ɛmpɛ okada ne pragya esiane dede ne atuturasɛm a wɔdi no akwan so nti no
The high incidence of accidents and fatalities associated with the reckless use of Okada, is also disturbing.	Akwanhyia ahodoɔ a ɛnam okada so ɛba no yɛ adeɛ a ɛwɔ sɛ ani kɔ ho
Indeed, many organisations, including the Ghana Medical Association and the National Road Safety Authority, have called for a total ban on their usage as a mode of transport in the country.	Nnwumakuo bebree a Ghana Medicalassociationne National Road Safety Authority ka ho na afrɛ sɛ wɔntua okada a ɛdi dwuma wɔ ɔman no mu no
This has left the country in a deep-blue sea.	Wei ato ɔman no agyaagyaa mu
This is because, despite the existence of the law banning their use for commercial purposes, they are a major source of relief to many Ghanaians.	Aba saa no sei ɛfiri sɛ ɛmmfa ho ne mmara a wɔahyɛ de atua saa nnoɔma yi, abɛyɛ ahotɔsoɔ ama Ghanafoɔ pii
For us at the Daily Graphic, we think that the country should relook at the law comprehensively and come up with the most appropriate measures that will suit the needs of the population in line with best practice.	Yɛn a yɛwɔ Daily Graphic ha deɛ yɛsusu sɛ ɔman no hwɛ mmara no bio na yɛhwɛ akwan pa a yɛbɛtumi afa ama saa dwumadie yi akɔ so
In India, for instance, pragya is a major means of transport but we have not heard of complaints as we have in Ghana.	Sɛ wokɔ India a pragya na ɛdi akɔtene wɔ wɔn akɔneabadie mu nanso yɛntee nsɛmnsɛm fa ho te sɛ deɛ yɛte no Ghana no
So, what can we learn from India and introduce it into our system?	Enti ɛdeɛn na yɛbɛtumi asua afiri India hɔ a yɛbɛtumi de aba de aba yɛn sestɛm no mu?
We need to bear in mind that with the increasing rate of unemployment, the okada and tricycle operators see it as a source of income which caters for them and their families.	ɛwɔ sɛ yɛde hyɛ yɛn adwene mu sɛ esiane adwumasɛm a ayɛ den nti wɔn wɔtwi okada ne pragya hu no sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma a wɔbɛnya afiri mu de ahwɛ wɔn ho ne wɔn abusuafoɔ
But as of now, okadas and pragyas are a nuisance and we at the Daily Graphic believe that with education, regulation and enforcement of the appropriate regimes, the operators must be made to conform if it is established that the country cannot do without them.	Seesei ara okada ne pragya abɛyɛ ɔhaw ne ateetee na yɛn yɛwɔ Daily Graphic susu sɛ yɛma wɔn nteteeɛ ne yɛyɛ nhyehyɛeɛ a wɔbɛfa so aka afidie no a ɛbɛboa ama ɔman no akɔ so
In reviewing the current law or system under which they operate, professional training, a licensing regime both for the rider and motorcycle/motor tricycles as well an insurance cover to cater for accidents will be most appropriate.	Wɔrehwɛ mmara a ɛma kwan ma wɔyɛ adwuma no, wɔyɛɛ nhyehyɛeɛ a ɛbɛhwɛ wɔn a wɔka afidie no sɛ akwanhyia biara ba mu a
With such a system in place, it will be easier for the Ghana Police Service to enforce the law and also deal with unregistered motorbikes and motor tricycles as well as those involved in criminal activities.	Sɛ wɔde nhyehyɛeɛ no gu akwan mu a ɛbɛboa ama Ghana Polisifoɔ no ahyɛ mmara no kena na aboa ma wɔakye okada ne pragya a wɔde di krɔno no
Currently, Ghanaians are divided over the regularisation of these two major means of transport because of their advantages and disadvantages.	Mprɛmprɛn yi Ghanafoɔ pii no ara na wɔn adwene ayɛ wɔn ntata wɔ saa mmara yi ho esiane ɛho mfaso papa ne bɔne
The Daily Graphic believes that if we want to have decency on our roads and improve our transportation system, then we have to comprehensively hold the bull by the horn and address the problem now or never.

I don’t recall a happier day in my recent memory in Ghana than last Friday, the Green Ghana day.	Menkae da biara m’ani gyee wɔ Ghana sɛ Fiada a atwa mu yi a na ɛyɛ Green Ghana da.
This was the day that we were all urged to go out and plant a tree.	Yei ne da a yɛn nyinaa ara bɔɔ mu kɔɔ abɔten sɛ yɛrekɔ dua dua.
Since I came back to Ghana 20 years ago and to the realisation that the reality of our country was very different from what was in the Geography books, this was the most successful attempt at doing something to reverse the catastrophic degradation of our lands.

Five million seedlings were made available by the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources for us to plant and there was a joyful atmosphere that I hadn’t noticed for a long time.

It might well be that enough Ghanaians had noticed that the one thing that needed our attention more than anything else was the state of the land mass that we call Ghana.	Ghanafoɔ bɛhwɛ ahu a na adeɛ baako a ɛhia sɛ yɛte y'ani hwɛ sene bibiara aka paa ara ne yɛn nsaasetam teabea a yɛfrɛ no Ghana no.
Far more than any potholed road, any dilapidated school, any hospital without beds or any schoolchildren without computers and I daresay, even the worst of any rampaging virus, what we should all get and remain agitated about is the state of our land, the land that had lost its forest cover, the rivers that are drying up, what used to be a wet month of May turning out hot and totally dry.	Adeɛ a ɛho hia sene akwan mu mmena, sukuu dan a atete, ayaresabea a nni mpa anaa sukuu nkwadaa nni abɛɛfo badwemma mfidie mpo no, merepae mu aka sɛ mpo yareɛ a ɛretrɛ no adeɛ baako a ɛwɔ sɛ yɛn nyinaa bo fu ho paa ne yɛn nsaase tebea, nsaase a ayera ne kwaeɛ, ne nsutene awe, sutɔberɛ Kɔtɔnima bosome a seisei ara abɛyɛ ɔhyew ne ɔpɛ.
I haven’t taken a look at the Geography textbooks that are being used in our schools today, but I do know that the characteristics of the land mass of Ghana in the books I used at school certainly do not look like present day Ghana.	Menhwɛɛ asaase ho adesua nwoma a asuafoɔ resua wɔ sukuu mu nansei nanso mɛtumi aka sɛ sɛnea na Ghana nsaase teɛ berɛ a ne mekɔ sukuu no nte sɛ nnɛ Ghana.
We still talk about dense tropical forests, but that is not the reality of our lands.	Yɛgu so kasa fa kwaeɛ dodoɔ ho nanso nokwasɛm no sɛ nnyɛ sei na yɛn nsaase no teɛ
We still talk about wild animals but they had been hunted down and their habitats taken over long ago.	Yɛgu so kasa fa kwaeɛ mu mmoa ho nanso y'aku wɔn nyinaa ara agye watenabea abɔ so.
The dense tropical forests and wild animals now exist only as part of our language and not part of our reality.	Kwaeɛ dodoɔ ne mu mmoa no abɛka yɛn kasa ho nanso nte saa ara koraa
Even what we thought were forest reserves have been shown to have been hollowed out in the search for gold and other minerals.	Mpo nea na yɛdwene sɛ ɛyɛ kwaeɛ a yɛmfa yɛn nsa nka no nyinaa ara yatu mu agudeɛ ne sika kɔkɔɔ nyinaa ara ama no asa.
Maybe our reality got through to most of us and I am hoping that those who did not take part had very good reasons not to have done so.	Ebia yɛn nokwaredie
