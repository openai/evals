To my mind, if anyone or group of people need to be named and shamed in today’s Ghana, it is those who did not bother to go and get a seedling and plant last Friday.	M'adwene mu no sɛ nipa anaa nnipakuo biara wɔ hɔ a ɛwɔ sɛ yɛbɔ wɔn din huru wɔn wɔ Ghana ha a na ɛyɛ wɔn a annyɛ w'asɛnhia sɛ wɔbɛkɔ abɔnten akɔpɛ nnuaba akɔ dua nnua Fiada a atwa mu yi no.
If you see it fit to comment on anything and everything, on things that are going wrong, on unpaved roads, on Free SHS, on the rate of borrowing, on the absence of street lights and even on Supreme Court rulings and you did not plant a tree last Friday, you should be ashamed of yourself, even if you are not named and shamed publicly.	Sɛ wohu sɛ ɛho behia a wobɛkasa afa bibiara ho a, nneɛma a nkɔ yie, akwan a yɛnguu so, Free SHS, bosea a yɛrebɔ ho, akwan a nkanea nni so mpo Asɛnnibea Kɛseɛ atɛmmuo na woannua dua Fiada a atwa mu yi a,
I would suggest though that it is not too late to redeem yourself if you happen to fall in this category.	Mɛsusu ho sɛ sɛ wo ka nnipakuo yi ho a ɛnkaa akyire sɛ wobɛsan woho.
Planting seedlings and having them grow into the beautiful and majestic trees that we need to cover our land is a long term undertaking.	Yɛredua nnuaba ama anyini abɛyɛ nnua a ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛgyina so de akata yɛn man yi so yɛ mmere tenten adwuma.
Having planted the seedlings, they need to be tended and nurtured and it takes time and hard work.	Yadua nnua yi awie no, ɛwɔ sɛ yɛhwɛ wɔn yie ma wɔnyini na ɛno nso hia mmerɛ ne adwumaden.
Last Friday, it rained in Accra, (and I hear in many other parts of the country) which was enough to make a believer of me, considering how dry it had been.	Fiada atwa mu yi nsuo tɔɔ wɔ Nkran, (mate sɛ ɛtɔɔe wɔ mantam ahodoɔ wɔ ɔman yi mu) yɛhwɛ sɛ nea ɔpɛ aba yi a na megye di sɛ na ɛtwa sɛ ɛtɔ.
The seedlings need to be watered regularly if the rains don’t come. Under normal circumstances, a better date couldn’t have been chosen than June 11 for the mass planting, but things aren’t what they used to be with our weather and our land and therefore the seedlings might need more care than they otherwise would have needed.	Nsuo antɔ a ɛwɔ sɛ yɛtae gu nnuaba no so nsuo. Na mmerepa biara nni hɔ nsene Kitawonsa da a ɛtɔ dubaakob a yɛtu sii hɔ sɛ yɛbɛdua nnua nanso wiem nsakyeraeɛ ne yɛn nsaase nte sɛ nea na ɛte kane no biom nti ɛwɔ sɛ ani ba nnuaba no ho yie.
If you missed planting last Friday, you can still plant one or two and you can certainly help look after those that have been planted.	Sɛ woannua dua Fiada a atwa mu yi a wobɛtumi adua baako anaa mmienu bi na woaboa abɔ nea yadua dada no ho ban
Cutting down a tree takes so little time, but growing a tree to full maturity to attain its regal and intimidating status takes years.	Mmere tiawa pɛ na yɛde twa dua ato fam nanso woredua ama n'aso aduru mpɛnpɛnsoɔ a ɛsi pi no yɛ mfeɛ bebree asɛm.
If we are to restore this land of ours to the ‘dense tropical forest’ described in the Geography books and in the songs of our festivals, then, as President Akufo-Addo said, Greening Ghana will have to become a regular and integral part of our activities.	Sɛ yɛbɛtumi adane yɛn nsaase yi ani akɔ 'kwaeɛ brentuo' a asaase ho adesua nwoma ne y'afahyɛ ho nnwom, sɛ nea ɔmanpanin Akufo-Addo kaaeɛ no, yɛreyɛ Ghana ahaban mono bɛba abɛyɛ dwumadie titire ama yɛn.
That presupposes, of course, that we shall stop degrading the lands in the first place, give them some breathing space to rejuvenate and then when we plant, the trees can grow in peace.	Mesusu sɛ nea ɛdi kan no sɛ yɛbɛgyae asaase sɛeɛ na yɛma yɛn nsaase mmerɛ ma ne home na ɛsa neho yareɛ wie na yɛdua nnua no a ɛbɛnyini wɔ asomdwoeɛ mu.
I probably also have to declare an interest here. I am a child of the forest, I was born in a forest area, even though the place no longer qualifies as a forest area.	Mereda m'anikusɛm bi adi wɔ ha. Meyɛ kwaeɛ mu ba, yɛwoo me kwaeɛ mu nanso ɛwɔ mu sɛ bea koro no koraa nnyɛ kwaeɛ mu biom.
I adore trees, there is nothing that can replace the experience of an afternoon heavy rainfall in a thick forest and the sweet smell that arises from the soil after the rain.	Medɔ nnua, bibiara ntumi nhyɛ anigyeɛ awia nsutɔ berɛ wɔ kwaeɛburentuo mu ne hwam a nsuo no tɔ wie a ɛfiri annwea no mu ba no.
Every child must have the opportunity to experience it and to look up and around trees that are older than their great grandparents.	Ɛwɔ sɛ abɔfra biara nya saa suahunu yi mu akwannya hwɛ wiem mu nnua a anyini sene wɔn nana prenu.
Another personal declaration of interest is that one of my very favourite people in this world is the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, Samuel Abu Jinapor, the Honourable Member of Parliament for Damongo.	M'anikusɛm foforɔ a mereda nadi ne nnipa a medɔ wɔn yie wɔ wiase mu ha paa ne ɔsoafoɔ a ɔhwɛ nsaase ne agudeɛ so, Samuel Abu Jinapor, Mmarahyɛbɛdwani a ɔwɔ Damango.
Once upon a time when you were appointed a Minister of Mineral Resources, it was a beautiful job, now you are dealing with the degradation of lands, the pollution of rivers and having to burn excavators.	Mmerɛ bi a atwa mu a yɛyii wo sɛ ɔsoafoɔ a ɔhwɛ fagudeɛ so no, na ɛyɛ adwuma ɛyɛ fɛ, afei rekɔ atia asaase ne nsu sɛeɛ ne mfidi a yɛde tutu fam hyeɛ.
I want Ghana to be returned to a land of thick forests, majestic trees, clean and beautiful rivers and I want it to happen under the tenure of Minister Abu Jinapor.	Mepɛ sɛ Ghana san kɔ ne nkyi kɔ yɛ ɔman a ɛwɔ kwaeɛbirentuo, nnua a ɛgyina so, nsutene a ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ korɔgyee na mepɛ sɛ yei nyinaa ara si wɔ Ɔ soafoɔ Abu Jinapor mmerɛ so.
I couldn’t quite decide what to make of him in that Rangers uniform last Friday but I could certainly see the amount of hard work that had gone into the planning and execution of the project. I am wishing him well and I am hoping that every one of the seedlings that was planted last Friday survives and thrives.	Na mehunuu nea menyɛ meho berɛ a mehunuu sɛ ɔhyɛ Rangers ataadeɛ Fiada a atwa mu no nanso mehunuu adwumaden a ɛkɔ dwumadie yi nhyehyɛeɛ ne wieeɛ mu.

A green Ghana will be a prosperous Ghana.	Ahaban mono Ghana bɛyɛ yiedie Ghana.
When it comes to good music, Highlife musician Akwaboah cannot be ignored, but he will easily skip your mind when you are talking about A List musicians in Ghana and that is because he is not in our faces all the time.	Sɛ ɛba dwom pa a, woyi highlife dwontoni Akwaboah nsi nkyɛn a nnyɛ yie nanso ɛnnyɛ den koraa sɛ worebobɔ dwomtofoɔ a ɛdi mu a wobɛbɔ no afa so firisɛ nnyɛ dabiara na yɛte no nka.
However, the musician is not worried that he is not at the top of people’s list. He told Graphic Showbiz that he was not in competition with any musician and not being in the public eye all the time allowed him room to release quality songs.	Nanso dwontoni no se nha no koraa sɛ ɔnka amanfoɔ adwontofoɔ a ɛdi mu kuo ho. ƆƆ ka kyerɛɛ. Graphic Showbiz sɛ ɔne dwontoni biara nni akansie na biom nso ɔnyi n'anim nkyerɛ dabiara no ɛboa no ma no pa dwom pa ho adi.
According to Akwaboah, releasing songs back to back just to help keep an artiste’s name out there did not guarantee sustainability.	Akwaboa kyerɛ mu sɛ, dwom a yɛda nadi ntoatoasoɔ sɛ ɛbɛma dwontoni din aka manfoɔ tiri mu no nnyɛ bɔhyɛ wɔbɛkura wo mu daa.
“I don’t rush to release songs because I want to take my time and get it right. So many musicians made hits but in just a short time, they were nowhere to be found. I don’t want to be that kind of artiste. I am not under any pressure to release hit songs and anytime I drop something new, Ghanaians just love it.	"""Mempere meho mpa dwom ho firisɛ mepɛ sɛ meto me bo ase na menya no yie. Adwontofoɔ bebree a wɔn dwom gyee din nanso berɛ tiawa mu no yanhunu wɔn biom. Mempɛ sɛ mɛyɛ te sɛ saa adwontofoɔ yi.

“It is always not the best to keep releasing hit after hit. Ghanaians are some way and if they decide not to pay attention to you again, there is nothing you will do to impress them. I prefer to stay this way for the next 15 years than to do hit after hit songs and be forgotten in a year or two,” he told Graphic Showbiz recently.	"""Nnyɛ sɛ dabiara wopa dwom foforɔ adi.

The Zimbabwe Republic Police has launched a campaign aimed at preventing violence against women and girls, especially during elections.	Zimbabwe apolisifoɔ ahyɛ anammɔntuo bi a ɛbɛko atia ayakayakadeɛ a mmaa ne mmayewa wɔ abatoɔ berɛ mu.
Police launched the campaign on Wednesday with the support of human rights organizations, especially women's rights, the Canadian embassy in Zimbabwe, and the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe.	Nnipa ho faahodie kuo te sɛ mma faahodie, Canada Asoeɛ a ɛwɔ Zimbabwe ne Zimbabwe Man Kwaadubɔfoɔ Asoeɛ boaa apolisifoɔ daa saa dwumadie yi adi Wukuada.
Speaking at the rally, the police chief, Commissioner-General Godwin Matanga, said the police would not be complacent in matters of violence against women during elections.	Apolisifoɔ panin, Commissioner-General Godwin Matanga rekasa wɔ dwumadie no ase no daa no adi sɛ polisifoɔ mfa nsɛm a ɛfa mmaa ayakayakadeɛ ahogono so.
He also urged women to report cases of violence or abuse without fear.	Ɔ hyɛɛ mmaa nso sɛ wɔnyi hu nto nkyɛn na wɔmbɔ ayakayakadeɛ ho amanneɛ.
The chairperson of the Women's Coalition of Zimbabwe, Sally Ncube, also said she was impressed by the police's commitment to prevent violence against women during elections.

Some doctors in the country at hospitals such as the West End and Parirenyatwa are refusing to treat people suspected of having coronavirus because they do not have the expertise and expertise.

On Monday, some nurses also protested at Mpilo Hospital, saying they did not have the necessary protection against the disease.	Nɛɛsefoɔ bi nom nso tee atua wɔ Mpilo Ayaresabea Dwoada no firisɛ wɔnni ahobanbɔ nneɛma wɔde bɛko atia yareɛ no.
The Ministry of Infectious Diseases in the Ministry of Health, Dr Portia Manangazira, also told Studio7 that a Zimbabwean woman from China had failed to receive treatment in Parirenyatwa.

Parirenyatwa Hospital later investigated the case and ruled that it would not transmit the disease to patients such as coronaviruses, saying such people should be legally referred to Wilkins Hospital and Beatrice Infectious Hospital as a way of trying to prevent other patients and doctors at the hospital from being infected with coronavirus.	Parirenyatwa Ayaresabea yɛ nhwehwɛmu akyire baa agyinaeɛ sɛ wɔnhwɛ mma ayarefoɔ nte corona virus yareɛ no nti ayarefoɔ nkɔ gye ayarehwɛ wɔ Wilkins Hospital ne Beatrice Infectious Ayaresabea sɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ a ayarefoɔ ne ayaresafoɔ a ɛwɔ ayaresabea hɔ nte corona virus yareɛ no.
The hospital also said it would set up a tent outside the hospital to screen those suspected of having the disease and then refer them to the so-called specialist hospitals.

Harare City Council's chief medical officer, Dr Prosper Chonzi, also said that the West End hospital refused to help a Chinese woman who died thinking she had coronavirus but did not.

Harare City Council is warning residents of Budiriro and Glen Norah communities not to use water from wells or wells they are digging as the water is contaminated.	Harare Kurokɛseɛ Fotufokuo abɔ manfoɔ a wɔte Budiriro ne Glen Norah mpɔtam sɛ mma wɔn nnom abura mu nsuo anaa mbura a wɔretutu firisɛ nsuo no nnyɛ.
Due to the frequent lack of tap water, residents in areas such as Glen Norah and Budiriro, are using well water.	Ɛnam nsuo a ɛho ayɛ den nti, manfoɔɔ a ɛtete Glen Norah ne Budiriro de abura mu nsuo na ɛyɛ adeɛ.
But council spokesman Michael Chideme said a study conducted in Budiriro village by Glen Norah found that many mines were contaminated with diarrheal diseases such as typhoid fever.

Mr Chideme said most of the mines being used in the area were shallow, which would lead to the severity of the sewers.	Mr Chideme kaa sɛ fagudeɛtubea bebree no ara mu nnɔ nti ɛbɛma yareɛ no akɔ soro
Chideme said the council is providing water to these areas on a regular basis.	Chideme kaa sɛ fotufokuo no rema manfoɔ a ɛwɔ mpɔtam yi nsuo dabiara.
The head of the Community Water Alliance, Mr Hardlife Mudzingwa, criticized the council saying the lack of council water was the main reason for residents to mine mines.	Panin a ɔda Mpɔtam Nsuo Nkabomkuo ano, Mr Hardlife Mudzingwa bɔɔ futofokuo no akyi sɛ ɛnam nsuo a mma nti na manfoɔ retu fagudeɛ no.
Mr Mudzingwa also said some areas do not always get water.	Mr Mudzingwa toaa so sɛ mantam bi nom nnya nsuo dabiara.
Many residents of Harare do not have regular access to council water which has led to mining in mining villages even though it is not permitted by council regulations.	Harare manfoɔ bebree no ara nnya nsuo dabiara ɛno nti na fagutudeɛ ɛrekɔ so nkuraaseɛ berɛ wabra sɛ mma obiara nnyɛ saa.

Ansarul Islam, meaning Defenders of Islam, is the home-grown group, founded in 2016 by the radical and popular preacher Ibrahim Malam Dicko, who is said to have fought with Islamist militants in Mali when they took over the north of country in 2012, prompting France's intervention.

It was the leader of a four-party coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991, when a military regime was ousted from power.	Na ɛyɛ kuo nnan nkabomkuo na dii Ethiopia man no fi afe 1991 berɛ a wɔtuu asraafoɔ aban adeɛ so.
Under the coalition, Ethiopia became more prosperous and stable, but concerns were routinely raised about human rights and the level of democracy.	Wɔ saa nkabomkuo ase no, Ethiopia man no bɛgyinaaeɛ san dii yie nanso na nsɛmmisa wɔ nipa fahodie ne kabi-ma-menka bi ho.
Eventually, discontent morphed into protest, leading to a government reshuffle that saw Mr Abiy appointed prime minister.	Awieɛ no, nea nnipa nnye ho no bɛdanee ɔyɛkyerɛ maa aban sesaa nneɛma mu hwɛɛ maa wɔyii Mr Abiy sɛ Aban Panin.
Mr Abiy liberalised politics, set up a new party (the Prosperity Party), and removed key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression.

Meanwhile, Mr Abiy ended a long-standing territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.	Saa berɛ yi ara mu no, Mr Abiy hwɛ maa asaase ho ntɔkwa a na ɛda wɔn ne Eritrea ntam no baa awieɛ, yei maa no nyaa Nobel Peace Prize wɔ afe 2019 mu
These moves won Mr Abiy popular acclaim, but caused unease among critics in Tigray.	Saa ntotoeɛ yi maa Mr Abiy nyaa manfoɔ abasobɔdeɛ nanso ɛde ɔhaw baa wɔn a na wɔbɔ n'akyi wɔ Tigray mu.
Tigray's leaders saw Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralise power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system.	Tigray mpaninfoɔ nhuu Mr. Abiy nsakraeɛ yi sɛ kwan a ɔrefa so asɛe Ethiopia amanbuo nhyehyɛeɛ no na ɔde tumi no nyinaa ara aba ne nsam.
The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the central government to hold its own regional election.	Ntɔkwa no mu yɛ kɛse wɔ Ɛbɔ bosome no mu berɛ a Tigray buu aban mmara so too wɔn nkoara mantam aba.
The central government, which had postponed national elections because of coronavirus, said it was illegal.	Aban kɛseɛ no tuu abatoɔ no hyɛɛ da ɛnam corona virus yareɛ no nti kyerɛɛ sɛ wabu mmara so.
The rift grew when the central government suspended funding for Tigray and cut ties with it in October.	Ɔ ko no mu yɛɛ den berɛ a aban no gyaee sika a na ɔde ma Tigray san twaa ayɔnkofa a na ɛda wɔn ntam wɔ Ahinime bosome mu.
"At the time, Tigray's administration said this amounted to a ""declaration of war""."	"Saa berɛ no Tigray mpaninfoɔ no kaa sɛ yei kyerɛ sɛ ""wasuae ɔko"""
Tensions increased, and the eventual catalyst was when Tigrayan forces were accused of attacking army bases to steal weapons.	Ɔ haw no payaa ne mu maa ɛwieeɛ no wɔbɔɔ Tigray akofoɔ no kwaadu sɛ wato ahyɛ asraafoɔ so awia wɔn akodeɛ

But it is not just a case of governments versus insurgents, there is also a deadly rivalry taking place between supporters of al-Qaeda and IS. This rivalry is becoming so intense that French expert on jihad Olivier Guitta from GlobalStrat Risk Consultancy even predicts:	Nanso, ɛnyɛ aban no ne saa basabasaeɛfoɔ nko ara na wɔde abɔm; al-Qaeda ne IS akyitaafoɔ nso de abɔm a ɛnyɛ ketewa koraa na ano ayɛ den pa ara a French Jihad nimdefoɔ, Oliver Guitta a ɔwɔ GlobalStrat Risk ɔonsultanɔy ahyɛ nkɔm sɛ:

But they also have major differences in their approach.	Nanso sɛdeɛ wɔyɛ wɔn nnoɔma no bɔ abira.

Recent attacks on churches in northern Burkina Faso are likely to be the work of jihadists whose activities are growing in the region despite a military operation to contain Islamist militancy.

In his quest to become a cattle farmer, Chief Superintendent Tanko Issifu, last year, allegedly entered into a barter agreement with two herdsmen– Osman Mumuni and Seidu Braimah– who promised to sell to him cattle.	ɛnam sɛ, polisi paninyi Chief Superintendent, Iddrisu Tanko Issifu yɛɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛn nantwie nti no, wɔne saa anantwie hwɛsofoɔ, Osman Mumuni and Seidu Braimah yi kɔɔ apam na wɔhyɛɛ no sɛ wɔbɛma no anantwie.

However, the District Police Commander in an attempt to inspect the animals yielded no result as the herdsmen allegedly kept giving him excuses.	ɛyɛɛ no, sɛ polisi paninyi bisa anantwie no asɛm biara a, na wɔredaadaa no
“When he later tried to check up on the suspects and the animals numbering about 556 cattle and 40 calves, they told him the cattle had been sent to a far distance for grazing but failed to show the whereabouts of the animals,” the statement noted.

According to KPMG Global Mining Institute, Ghana presents several opportunities in the mining sector, especially in the gold industry. Statistically, it is proven that Gold represents Ghana’s major export commodity, providing, 50% of GDP, (Ministry of Land and Natural Resources (MLNR), 2003).

Mining has become a controversial business everywhere.	Agudietuo abɛyɛ adwuma a nnipa ani aba ho pa ara wɔ baabiara
The continuous debate of the mining business is due to its great economical contribution to the country.	Akyinegye ahodoɔ a ɛrekɔ so nyinaa fa agudietuo ho, ɛnam boa a ɛboa ɛkonomi no
Within the past few decades, Ghana’s mining sector specifically the small-scale mining sector has been defaced with arguments mainly as a result of its threats to sustainable development.

Small scale mining in Ghana generally refers to artisanal mining of precious minerals particularly gold and diamond. Artisanal and Small-scale mining is a practice that involves rudimentary techniques of mineral extraction, highly manual processes, hazardous working conditions, and frequently affecting the human and environmental bodies negatively.

In Ghana, it is estimated that two to three million people are engaged in this activity; about 170,000 are directly or indirectly into illegal mining (galamsey) as they solely depend on it for their livelihoods.

Illegal mining seeks to be the only alternative of alleviating poverty to the people involved but in two folds perpetuates poverty through high sensitivity to physical hazards, illness, accidents, and lack of knowledge about more efficient, safer, and environmentally friendly techniques.

In recent cases, there has been a season of tragedy as it has been recorded that people involved in this activity lost their lives as a result of being trapped when a pit collapses or a landslide occurs and affect the water bodies.

On Wednesday, November 11, 2009, an estimated 30 illegal miners lost their lives as a result of landslides at Dopoase in the Wassa Amenfi East District of the Western region where 14 out of the 18 retrieved corpses were women.

Similarly, there was another tragedy at Dunkwa-On-Offin in 2010 in the Central Region where several miners were trapped in a pit when it caved on them near the Offin river resulting in the death of 100 miners. The inception of this activity is not affiliated with a single body or organization. Citizens are equally to be criticized.

It is known that this activity takes place under cover of darkness or hidden places such as forests, existing farms, river beds, valley and remote areas aided by foreigners especially the Chinese.

Since 2000, about 50,000 Chinese gold miners have migrated to Ghana to engage in small-scale mining.	ɛfiri 2000, Chinesefoɔ bɛyɛ 50,000 na aba ɔman yi mu a, ɔreyɛ amenamudwuma yi a ɛmfa mmara kwan so no bi
The rapid relocation of these foreigners was mainly driven by the high demand for gold prices, increasing cultural corporation between China and Ghana and the largely informal nature of the illegal mining.

The remodel traditional method of using pickaxe, shovel and pan to new technology such as the use of excavators cause environmental threats and social conflicts where the indigenes attacked the armed Chinese miners. Consequently, there is a proven climatic and social change due to the nature of the work, bad weather conditions, and degradation of natural resources which disturbs human survival in these artisanal environments.

The primitive techniques of these miners which are illegal and unregulated contaminate the water as a result of the discharged sewage which contains toxic chemicals such as cyanide and other organic chemicals used in the processing of mineral ores. These chemicals together result in waste with high acid levels which either seep into underground water or flow into the environment posing danger to the people.

The unchanged attitudinal behaviour of the political actors, law enforcement bodies, local chiefs and farmers towards the practice of illegal mining make this activity thrive. The law enforcement body provides these foreigners with guns to defend themselves from locals on the grounds of generating a beneficial budget for the police and immigration authorities.	Saa suban yi a amanyɔfoɔ, banbɔfoɔ, nhemfo ne akuafoɔ ntumi nsesa no wɔ ɔko a yɛreko atia galamsey no ho no.

There is also a lack of political will to combat this activity which is evidently because these politicians also benefit from these activities; the political leaders send threats to the appointed leaders of the task force to release the seized excavators or lose their jobs which derails the nation’s fight against galamsey.

In a quest to fight this activity, in May 2013, former President, John Mahama set up an inter-ministerial task force to roll out illegal small-scale miners where they were able to deport 4592 Chinese officials by mid-July 2013 but despite their efforts failed to entirely wipe out illegal mining activities. Similarly in August 2017, the task force arrested over 1370 miners including 247 Chinese officials with consequent arrest 33, 15, 7, 24 in April, June, August and September respectively.

In a scientific published article by the World Bank titled, Strategy for African Mining, it is estimated that some 30,000 people are employed within the legalized segment of the Ghana small-scale mining sector.

According to the 2008 Ghana Chamber of Mines (GCM) report, illegal mining activities (galamsey) have been increasing with an estimated number between 300,000 and 500,000 artisan miners comprising one of the largest groups of illegal miners on the continent disregarding the small-scale mining laws promulgated in 1989 with its continuation in the Minerals and Mining Act, 2006 (Acts 703) which expresses the basic position that minerals in their natural state are owned by the state and outlines the license scheme for mineral operations, the incidence of the various mineral rights and the power of the principal regulatory institutions yielded no results as according to the 2008 Ghana Chamber of Mines (CGM) report, illegal mining activities have been increasing with an estimated number between 300,000 and 500,000 artisan miners yielding one of the largest groups of illegal miners on the continent.

Nationally, galamsey addresses huge sums in lost incomes and exports.	Galamsey ama ɔman mu no nyinaa ahwere sika botene ne nneɛma a yɛkra ba ɔman no mu ne
The government must however educate and provide the miners in the rural areas the needed resources in terms of tools for a safer conducive environment and preserve the natural bodies.	ɛsɛ sɛ aban no kyerɛkyerɛ amenamutufoɔ yi adwuma no ani so na ɔma wɔn ho akadeɛ sɛdeɛ ɛbɛyɛ a wɔtu a wɔnsɛe nsaase no
The means of controlling the galamsey activities do not entirely depend on the political actors.	Saa adwumadie yi nso nkyerɛ sɛ kyenkyenaa twan ɛhyɛ amanyɔfoɔ nsa

This can be done by educating them on the prices, providing them with well-equipped tools, creating a forum where miners can share their experiences on the financial means of production and processing respectively.

The government, through the Ministry for Lands and Natural Resources, subsequently held a two-day National Consultative Dialogue on Small-Scale Mining that, among other things, urged the government to firmly enforce the country’s laws on mining.	Aban no nam nsaase ne abɔdeɛ mu nneɛma asoeɛ no so yɛɛ nnaanu nhyimu faa ɔman mu no nyinaa adwene a wɔwɔ fa amenamutu nketewa adwuma no ho, deɛ ɛfiri mu bae no ne sɛ, aban no mfa agudietuo mmara no nyɛ adwuma
As a result of that dialogue, the Lands Minister directed all persons prospecting or carrying out reconnaissance activities in forest reserves to cease within seven days.	ɛnam saa nkɔmmɔtwetwe no nti no, nsaase soafoɔ no hyɛɛ wɔn a wɔreyɛ nsaase nhwehwɛmu wɔ nnyae kwae no mu no nyinaa sɛ wɔnnyae a wɔhyɛɛ wɔn nna nson pɛ
The move is said to be one of many to be rolled out as part of efforts to deal with illegal small-scale mining in Ghana.	Saa ɔkwan yi ne ahodoɔ binom na wɔbɛfa so de asi amenamutu adwuma nketewa a ɛnnam mmara kwan so no afiri hɔ.
he fight against galamsey is assuming a wrong turn due to Government’s own past failures in the fight. As a people, we must be worried because the havoc caused by galamsey activities is life-threatening and has the potential to endanger the collective future that we all envisage.	ɔko a yɛreko atia galamsey no reyɛ adan ɛnam aban no nkoguo ahodoɔ a wadi wɔ ɔko no mu. Yɛayɛ temanmufoɔ yi, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛha yɛn ɛnam sɛ, ɛso nsunsuansoɔ a saa galamsey adwuma yi de bɛba no, ɛbɛha yɛn nyinaa yɛ daakye
The activities of galamseyers are gradually leading to very serious irredeemable environmental situations which include loss of biodiversity, clean water and pollution of our soil.

It is obvious that the institutional framework for the implementation of small-scale mining laws has completely broken down with corruption taking center stage.	Adan adi pefee sɛ nnwumakuo a anka wɔboa ma yɛhyɛ yɛn agudietuo mmara mu kena no wɔde kataasehyɛ asɛe ne nyinaa
The failure of the Akufo Addo led government to deal with the situation within the last four years shows its weakness and incompetence in dealing with the issue of galamsey.	Akufo Addo nkoguo a wadi wɔ galamsey ko wɔ mfeɛ nan yi a atwam no kyerɛ ne mmerɛyɛ a ɔyɛ na bio nso no wɔnyɛ ɔkannifoɔ pa a ɔbɛtumi aboa ama yɛako atia galamsey no
The just ended Stakeholders dialogue was a confirmation of the failed approach adopted by the Government in the past four years.	Saa ɔmanfoɔ adwenekyerɛ yi yɛ adeɛ aban yi yɛɛ no mfeɛ nan a atwan no a ɛmaa no dii nkoguo no
We hoped that from the said Conference, new methodologies of dealing with the menace would have emerged for adoption.	Yɛrehwɛ anim sɛ saa nhyimu no ɔkwan mapa bi bɛfiri mu aba afa sɛdeɛ yɛbɛtumi asi saa ɔhaw yi ano
Sadly, the Statement issued by the Minister of Information conveying the resolutions of the Stakeholders’ forum as a way of dealing with the menace is a false start.	ɛyɛ mmɔbɔ sɛ, nsɛnkae a ɛfiri ɔsoafoɔ a ɔhwɛ amanneɛ de bae fa ɔmanfoɔ adwenekyerɛ fa ɔkwan a ɔbɛfa asi ɔhaw yi ano kwan yi mmoa wɔ ɔkwan biara so

The content of the statement suggests Government is involved in the business as usual and does not provide any critical out-of-the-box solution to addressing the challenge.	Nsɛnkae no kyerɛ sɛ aban no hyɛ adwuma no mu nanso ɔntumi mfa nhyehyɛe papa biara mma a ɛbɛboa asi ɔhaw no ano kwan
The President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo for the umpteenth time, indicated his commitment to fighting the phenomenon of illegal small-scale mining, commonly known as galamsey in Ghana.	ɔmanpanin Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo ka no mpɛn pii wɔ ne ho a ɔde ato hɔ amenamutu adwuma nketewa no a wɔsan frɛ no galamsey
The President reiterated he will do everything in his power in his second term to bring the galamsey menace to a halt in Ghana during a courtesy call on him by Okyehene Osagyefo Amoatia Ofori Panin and the Akyem Abuakwa Traditional Council.	ɔmanpanin san kaa sɛ, ɔbɛyɛ deɛ ɔbɛtumi biara wɔ ne tumi mu wɔ ne berɛ a ɛtɔ so mmienu yi de asi galamsey no kwan berɛ a Okyehene Osagyefo Amoatia Ofori Panin ne Akyem Abuakwa Traditional Council no too wɔn nsa frɛɛ no no
Prior to the meeting, the government through the Ministry for Lands and Natural Resources had held a two-day National Consultative Dialogue on Small-Scale Mining that, among other things, urged the government to firmly enforce the country’s laws on mining.	Ansa na saa nhyimu no rekɔbɛkɔ so no, aban no nam nsaase ne abɔdeɛ mu nneɛma asoeɛ no so yɛɛ nnaanu nhyimu faa ɔman mu no nyinaa adwene a wɔwɔ fa amenamutu nketewa adwuma no ho, deɛ ɛfiri mu bae no ne sɛ, aban no mfa agudietuo mmara no nyɛ adwuma
In furtherance of the resolutions of the final communiqué of the Stakeholder Dialogue on Small Scale Mining, and to ensure that mining within water bodies is immediately stopped; the President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has authorized the Ghana Armed Forces, to commence an operation to remove all persons and logistics involved in mining from Ghana’s water bodies.	“ɛnam adwenefa a ɛkɔɔ so faa amenamutu adwuma nketewa no ho a ɛrekyerɛ sɛ, ɛsɛ sɛ galmasey adwuma no wɔgyae no, Ghana manpanin Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo ahyɛ Ghana asraafoɔ sɛ wɔnhyɛ wɔn dwumadie no ase na wɔnyi obibiara ne nneɛma biara a ɔde reyɛ galamsey no mfiri nsuo no ani
Government seems to be adopting the same failed approach in the fight against galamsey, hence there is no guarantee of improved results. We cannot continue to do things the same way and expect a different result.	Anyɛ sɛdeɛ aban no de nhyehyɛe dada no ara na ɛreko galamsey no nti yɛnhu mpontuo biara wɔ mu. Yɛntumi ntoa so nyɛ ade dada no ara
Water bodies that were regaining their natural state at the height of the fight against galamsey are becoming polluted again due to the increasing activities of illegal miners in various parts of the country.	Nsuo ahodoɔ a na ani rete no nyinaa ani resan asɛe ɛnam sɛ nnipa binom gu so reyɛ galamsey no wɔ ɔman no afaanan binom
In July 2017, President Akufo Addo served notice that he was prepared to put his Presidency on the line in his quest to fight illegal mining.	Ayɛhummɔmɔ 2017 mu na ɔmanpanin Akufo Adoo de too dwa sɛ ɔde ne manpanyindie no bɛsi hɔ de ako atia galamsey
However, considering the state of galamsey today and its devastating effect on the environment including land, rivers, and water bodies, it is clear to all and sundry that the President’s fight against galamsey has failed.	Nanso no yɛhwɛ deɛ galamsey akɔdu nnɛ yi ne ɛso nsunsuansoɔ a anya wɔ nsaase, asubonten ne nsuo so a, biribiara kyerɛ sɛ ɔmanpanin ko a ɔreko atia galamsey no atɔ nsuo mu
The President, having failed to fight the menace, the honorable thing to do would be for him to resign from office to uphold his integrity.	Sɛ ɔmanpanin antumi anko ɔko yi dea, ɛneɛ ɔmfa n’akongua no nto hɔ, na yɛnhu sɛ ampa ɔdi ne nsɛm so
Dishonorably, we are again treated with a plethora of promises and assurances.	Seesei deɛ bɔhyɛ hunu ne nnaadaa na wɔde daadaa yɛn
Words they say are cheap.	Nsɛmka deɛ ɛyɛ fo
The President must walk the talk.	ɛsɛ sɛ ɔmanpanin de ne nsɛm yɛ adwuma
This galamsey matter is serious and must be given all the needed attention as a people.	Galamsey nsɛm yi yɛ asɛnhia nti ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn adwene kɔ so pa ara
Water is life.	Nsuo yɛ nkwa
Delivering a speech at the National Dialogue on Small Scale Mining on Wednesday, April 14, 2021, the President said interestingly that although he is determined to enforce the laws on individuals who are caught engaging in ‘Galamsey’, he will not activate them based on mere allegations.	Berɛ a ɔmanpanin de n’anodisɛm reto dwa wɔ ɔman no nyinaa nkɔmmɔ a ɛfa amenamutuo adwuma nketewa no ho no Wukuada, Oforisuo 14, 2021 no, ɔkaa sɛ wayɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔbɛma mmara ne obibiara a wɔbɛkye no sɛ ɔreyɛ galamsey no adi nanso no ɔntumi mma yɛnkye obi a onni adanseɛ
No Ghanaian has said the President should convict persons based on hearsay or lack of evidence.	Ghanani biara nni hɔ a wɔaka sɛ ɔmanpanin ntwe obi aso ɛnam deɛ wɔte anaa adanseɛ bi a enni hɔ so
In any case, the President does not have the power to convict any person in Ghana – only the Courts do.	Deɛ ɛteɛ ne sɛ ɔmanpanin no nni tumi sɛ, ɔbɛtwe obi aso wɔ Ghana ha, asɛnnibea nko ara na wɔbɛtumi asaa
The President’s position again demonstrates the seeming lack of interest in President Akufo Addo to tackle the galamsey menace head-on and crack down the whip on corruption.	ɔmanpanin no agyinatuo no ɔmma yɛnya gyidie wɔ ɔmanpanin Akufo Addo mu sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔboa ma yɛko galamsey yi a kataasehyɛ ahyɛ no ma yi.
This is in sharp contrast to promises by then Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Akufo Addo, who indicated his readiness to differently fight corruption through, among other things, the introduction of the Anas principle, the mode of investigation used by one of Africa’s ace investigative journalists, Anas Aremeyaw to create a new culture of fear for corrupt practices.	Wei ma ɛne bɔhyɛ ahodoɔ a saa berɛ no a ɔgyina New PatrioticParty no anan mu apre manpaninadwa no ɔhyɛɛ no. Nana Akufo Addo ma yɛtee aseɛ sɛ, ɔba a ɔbɛtu kataasehyɛ ne porɔeɛɛ ase aberɛ a ɔde Anas kwan no bi bɛdi dwuma. Anas yi yɛ Abibiman nhwehwɛmu sɛntwerɛfoɔ no mi baako a, a deɛ ɔyɛ ne sɛ, ɔyɛ nhwehwɛmu fa kataasehye ho.
It is therefore not surprising that up to date practically no sanctions have been meted out to Western Regional Secretary of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and former Secretary of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, Charles Bissue, for his role in the galamsey fraud scandal despite corruption allegations against him by Anas Aremayaw Anas, whose principle the President promised to adopt in the fight against corruption.

It is also no wonder that no action has been taken in respect of the missing excavators’ saga.	ɛnsan nyɛ nwanwa sɛ, wɔntuu anammɔn biara mfaa mfidie a wɔde tutu fam a ayera no ho no
Till now, no report has been issued by the Operation Vanguard Taskforce to update Ghanaians on their role, challenges, and impact in the fight against illegal mining.	ɛbɛsi nnɛ yɛntee hwee mfaa Operation Vanguardfoɔ no hɔ, ɔhaw ahodoɔ a wɔrekɔ mu, ne ɔko a ɔreko atia galamsey no deɛ akɔduru
Indeed, some military officers were caught in a Joy News documentary actively engaged in the activity.	Mmom deɛ, yɛhuu asraafoɔ binom wɔ ɛoy News kaseɛ mu sɛ wɔde wɔn ho agye adwuma yi mu
Hence, the resolutions and approach by the Government to adopt similar strategies by involving the military in an activity they have already been engaged in shows the lack of ideas and clear direction by the Government in tackling the phenomenon.	ɛneɛ na ɛkyerɛ sɛ, aban no de asraafoɔ reko tia adeɛ a yɛahu sɛ wɔreyɛ bi deɛ na kyerɛ sɛ yɛbɛka nokware dea, na sɛbɛ sɛbɛ aban no ankasa ɔnnim deɛ ɔreyɛ
For citizens to be fully confident of the Government’s fight against galamsey, Government must report fully to Ghanaians on the activities of the Operation Vanguard Taskforce and indicate to Ghanaians the whereabouts of the missing excavators.	Sɛ temanmufoɔ bɛnya aban no mu awerɛhyɛ mu dea, na agye sɛ adwuma biara a Operation Vanguardfoɔ no reyɛ no aban no ma yɛhu mu bi na bio nso no ɔkyerɛ yɛn baabi a mfidie a wɔde tutu fam no ara ayera no nyinaa afa
If the Akufo Addo-led Government wants the full support of Ghanaians in the fight against galamsey, there must be transparent and accountable and be willing to fully disclose who the interest holders are in all these galamsey sites.

Government must be clear on the sanctions it intends to impose on perpetrators as the present state of galamsey operations contravenes citizens’ rights to life, health, environment, and the principles of inter-generational equity. Furthermore, galamsey activities violate Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.	ɛsɛ sɛ aban hu asotwe pɔtee a ɔde rema wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho ahyɛ galamsey adwuma no mu no ɛnam sɛ, saa galamsey yi ko tia nnipa fahodie, apɔmuden, nsaase ɛnna Iner-generational equity nhyehyɛe no.

Mere orders to the military will not address this challenge as many of the officers themselves are complicit in the fight against illegal mining, without any known administrative actions and sanctions against them.	ɔhyɛ kɛkɛ a yɛhyɛ asraafoɔ yi sɛ ɔnko ntia galamsey adwuma yi ntumi mmoa mma yɛnni wɔn so nkonim ɛnam sɛ, asraafoɔ yi ankasa binom ka ho. ɛno nti no ɛsɛ sɛ yɛnya asotwe bi nso ma wɔn
The Member of Parliament (MP) for the Tamale North constituency in the Northern Region, Alhassan Suhuyini. is sceptical about the government’s renewed fight against illegal mining in Ghana.	mmarahyɛbɛdwani a ɔwɔ Tamale North a ɛwɔ Atifi mantam mu no, Alhassan Suhuyini, sɛ ɔno deɛ ɔnte aban nhyehyɛe no a ɔde reko galamsey no ase

Speaking on Citi TV‘s Breakfast Daily show on Thursday, April 29, 2021, the Tamale North legislator said the government should have supported the regional and district security services to deal with the menace, rather than deploying military men to the mining sites.

He noted that major rivers such as the Birim and Ankobrah have been polluted due to the activities of illegal small-scale miners and, as such, he will put more effort into the fight to ensure that future generations are not deprived of the water, mineral and natural resources currently being threatened by galamsey.

Illegal mining, locally referred to as ‘galamsey’, has, over the past few years, dominated national conversations following a major campaign by Citi FM highlighting the devastating effects of the practice.

His declaration was amidst new measures such as the deployment of police and military personnel to arrest illegal miners across the country and the introduction of a community mining programme aimed at regulating small-scale mining in communities in an environmentally sustainable manner.

Recently, there have been complaints that the water bodies that were regaining their natural state at the height of the fight against galamsey are becoming polluted again due to the increasing activities of illegal miners in various parts of the country.

The government,t through the Ministry for Lands and Natural Resources, subsequently held a two-day National Consultative Dialogue on Small-Scale Mining that, among other things, urged the government to firmly enforce the country’s laws on mining.

This is according to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), Joseph Boahen Aidoo.	Ghana kookoo adwumakuo no nnaanoni, Joseph Boahen Aidoo na ɔde saa asɛm yi too dwa
It follows threats from the EU that it will ban cocoa from Ghana if the negative impact of illegal mining on the country’s environment persists.	Eyi gyina kɔkɔbɔ a EU foɔ de bɔɔ yɛn faa ɔsom a sɛ Ghana anhwɛ yie a ɔde bɛto yɛn kookoo no so no ɛnam galamsey no ara ɛresɛe yɛn nsaase no.

Though the corporation has pledged to ensure safe mining activities, A Rocha feels the illegal activities will be beyond its control.	ɛwom sɛ ekuo no ahyɛ sɛ ɔbɛhwɛ atoto amenamutu no yie, A Roɔha nso hu ne sɛ galamsey bɛba abɛdi afra mu
“The problem observed by GIADEC will only get worse with bauxite mining: building mining roads into closed forests opens up currently inaccessible areas to illegal operators,” A Rocha said in a statement.

“The illegal mining and logging you see today will flourish in the protected area once GIADEC facilitates access for illegal actors,” it added.	Galamseyfoɔ yi bɛbɔ awura mmeaɛ a wɔntumi nkɔ hɔ sɛ GIADEC hyɛ aseɛ sɛ wɔreyɛ adwuma pɛ a
A Rocha stressed that mining in in the Atewa forest “will be a terminal cancer that will erode forest integrity and the ecosystem services they provide over time”.	A Roɔha si so bio sɛ, sɛ wɔtu agudie wɔ Atewa kwae no mu a, ɛbɛyɛ ɔhaw kɛseɛ a ɛbɛsɛe kwae no mu die ne ne nneɛma a ɛwɔ mu no
It urged GIADEC to follow in the footsteps of aluminium companies that have agreed not to use raw materials sourced from the Atewa Forest.	ɔhyɛ GIADEC sɛ ɔnhwɛ anammɔn a aluminiɔm adwumakuo no bi adi kan atu no, wɔmfa abɔdeɛ mu nneɛma a ɛfiri Atewa kwae no mu.
Members of the International Union for Conversation of Nature (IUCN) on November 4, 2020, voted to adopt Motion 103 calling for “Urgent measures to safeguard the globally important Atewa Forest in Ghana”.

“If GIADEC is to fulfil its stated commitment to international best practices and standards, the Atewa Forest must be completely off-limits to bauxite mining,” A Rocha said.	A Roɔha san de too dwa sɛ, sɛ mpo GIADEC sɛ ɔde nhyehyɛe mapa bɛgu akwan mu de ayɛ n’adwuma mpo a, Atewa kwae no deɛ, wɔnyi mfiri mu
The Atewa Forest is a Key Biodiversity Area teeming with thousands of animal species and a source of clean drinking water for more than 5 million Ghanaians.	Atewa kwae no yɛ kwae a ɛyɛ beaeɛ ma mmoadoma pii na ɛsan nso ma yɛn nsuo a ani te na Ghanafoɔ a ɔboro ɔpepemnum nya bi nom.
A Rocha Ghana has read the statements made by GIADEC during a meeting with journalists and published on Monday 5 April and is responding to key points raised.	A Roɔha Ghana akan nsɛnkae a GIADEC de too nsɛnkyerɛfoɔ anim na ɛbaa mmɔtenso Dwoada, 5 Oforisuo a ɔreyi nsɛm binom ano no.
GIADEC said it rejects as ‘propaganda’ an apparent claim that the whole of Atewa Forest will be destroyed by bauxite mining.	GIADEC sɛ nsɛnkae a ɛfa sɛ wɔbɛsɛe Atewa kwae no nyinaa ɛnam bauxitetuo no nti no ɔbɔ gu
It says the area it will be ‘playing’ with – a surprising term to use for an activity that will cause so much damage to livelihoods, species, habitats, and clean water – is about 10% or less over 50 years, and would mine 5 million tonnes of bauxite in that time.	ɔka sɛ, saa beaɛ no yɛ baabi a sɛ wode yɛ saa adwuma no a ɛbɛsɛe asetena mu nneɛma, nnua, mmoa tenabea ne nsu pa. Na eyi yɛ ɔha mu nkyekyɛmu du anaa ɛboro mfeɛ aduonum na bauxite a wɔbɛtu no yɛ tɔnso no ɔpepemnum
To be clear, civil society’s concerns are over the location proposed for bauxite mining – that is, the mountain tops – as this is within Atewa’s legally protected area and is also the most critical for biodiversity and clean water. Loss of the forest and habitats here would be irreversible and would also cause wider damage to the integrity and ecosystem service provision of a much greater area of forest around it.	Sɛdeɛ yɛbɛte m’ase yie no, wɔn a wɔnka banbɔ kuo ho no haw yi nyinaa yɛ beaeɛ a wɔrekɔtu bauxite no. ɛhɔ yɛ bepɔ no soro.

But GIADEC seems to completely miss this point.	Nanso ɛrekame ayɛ sɛ GIADEC ɛnhu saa nneɛma yi nyinaa
Bauxite mining in Atewa Forest, no matter how small, will be a terminal cancer that will erode forest integrity and the ecosystem services they provide overtime.	Sɛ agudie a wɔretuo ne kɛseɛ te sɛn, ɛso anaasɛ ɛsoa wɔ Atewa kwae no mu a, ɛbɛyɛ ɔhaw kɛseɛ a ɛbɛsɛe kwae no mu die ne ne nneɛma a ɛwɔ mu no
Atewa is a critical forest ecosystem, it is not to be ‘played’ with.	Atewa kwae no ho hia yɛn pa ara nti yɛntumi mfa nni agorɔ
The statement said that participants were briefed on a baseline biodiversity study of the proposed mining area as part of documenting the area’s life forms.	Nsɛnkae no kyerɛ sɛ, wɔn a wɔrekɔyɛ adwuma yi no, wɔkyerɛɛ wɔn ɛho nhyehyɛe bi a beaeɛ a wɔrekɔtu agudie no teɛ
But this is unnecessary. Several research documents both recent and old have already been published of the species found in Atewa Forest including the proposed mining area.	Nanso no eyi ho nhia. ɛnam sɛ nkrataa bebree no ara na wɔatwerɛ afa Atewa kwae no ho ne nneɛma ahorow a ɛwɔ mu a baabi a wɔtu agudie yi mpo ka ho
These reports show that Atewa Forest contains many endangered and endemic species that would be threatened with extinction if bauxite mining goes ahead. Instead of another biodiversity report, an independent Social and Environmental Impact Assessment (ESIA) is what is urgently needed to document how mining will impact on the forest, species, habitats, ecosystem services, livelihoods and access to clean water.

An ESIA is supposed to form part of any decision-making process over whether or not a development action should go ahead, but this has not been done.	ɛsɛ sɛ saa nhwehwɛmu a ɛfa abrabɔ ne atenae mu nsɛm ho no ka yɛn adwemfa dwumadie ho
GIADEC’s statements did claim that reclamation plans have been proposed as well as draft report produced.	GIADEC nsɛm kyerɛ sɛ wasusu nsiesiekwan ahodoɔ ne kwan a wobɛfa so de nkrataa akyerɛ.

Private sector investors are also urged caution. The IUCN’s Resolution 087 passed in November 2020 urging protection of the Atewa Forest and which received overwhelmingly support, “STRONGLY REQUESTS” all companies in the mining sector not to participate in any mining activities in or near Atewa Forest and all companies using aluminium to ensure that no aluminium from Atewa Forest enters their supply chains”.

The Concerned Citizens of Atewa Landscape (CCAL) have made it very clear that they do not want mining companies entering their forests and destroying their resources, livelihoods, and clean water sources.

Civil society supports their stand and urges caution to any private sector company interested in mining bauxite in the Atewa Forest.	Temanmufoɔ agye wɔn nsusueɛ no ato mu afoa so de kɔkɔbɔ akɔma akorankorɛ nwumakuo a wɔn pɛ ne sɛ wobetu agudeɛ wɔ Atewa kwaeɛ no mu no.
A number of aluminium user companies have already stated their objections to aluminium produced with bauxite from Atewa.	Nwumakuo a wɔde alominion de dwuma no nnye alominion a wɔde bauxite a wɔtu no Atewa yɛ no nto mu.
If GIADEC is to fulfil its stated commitment to international best practices and standards, the Atewa Forest must be completely off limits to bauxite mining.	Enti sɛ GIADEC pɛ sɛ ɔkyerɛ wɔn anibere wɔ deɛ woreka no ho a, ɛneɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ bauxite nko ara na wɔntu no wɔ Atewa kwaeɛ no mu.
GIADEC has done one good thing, though, by raising the issue of illegal mining and forest destruction in Atewa Forest, stating we will one day “get up and find that there is no forest at all”.	Mmom GIADEC ayɛ ade pa baako, ɛna sɛ, w’aboa abɔ ɛfam agudietuo a ɛmfa mmara kwan so ne sɛdeɛ wɔresɛe Atiwa kwaeɛbiretuo no ho dawuro a wɔrekyerɛ sɛ, sɛ yɛbɛsɔre dakoro na kwaeɛ biara nni hɔ.
Civil society has also made this point countless times over the years.	ɔivil soɔiety nso aka saa asɛm korɔ no ara mperɛ bebree
The destruction of state gazetted forests by illegal activities should be the concern of any state agency that has the wellbeing of Ghanaians at its centre.

Citizens should not have to fight our government agencies to ensure that we benefit from the judicious and sustainable use of our natural resources. Or is the government and its agencies deliberately allowing the forest to be decimated by illegal actors, to serve as justification for mining it? A typical case of “give the dog a bad name so you can hang it”? (while communities continue to suffer the impacts?)

The problem observed by GIADEC will only get worse with bauxite mining: building mining roads into closed forests opens up currently inaccessible areas to illegal operators.	ɔhaw a GIADEC ahu no bɛgye nsam berɛ a yɛrentu bauxite no: ɛkwan a yebeyi wɔ Kwaeɛ no mu no bɛma mmeaeɛ a akanee na nnipa ntumi nkɔ na w’atumi akɔ

The Ghana Water Company Limited in the Eastern Region says activities of illegal small scale miners, popularly referred to as galamsey, continue to hinder water operations.	Nsuo adwumakuo a ɛwɔ ɔman Ghana mu fa a ɛwɔ apueɛ fa mu ka sɛ galamseyfoɔ no mmoa mma nsuosɛm nkɔ nkan.
Currently, the water company is rationing water in most parts of the region and has on numerous occasions shut down water treatment plants at Osino, Bunso, and Kyebi as a result of activities of illegal miners.

Speaking during his vetting, Dr. Afriyie cited the introduction of heavy earth moving equipment to small scale mining in 1989 as the day “Ghana’s environmental problems begun.”	ɔrekasa wɔ bere a yɛretoto n’ano no, Dr. Afriyie kyerɛɛ sɛ berɛ a ɔman no hyɛɛ aseɛ de mfidie akɛseɛ tutu agudie wɔ afe 1989 na Ghana nsaase sɛeɛ hyɛɛ aseɛ
He thus said Ghana must regulate excavators “severely.”	ɔkaa sɛ, Ghana bɛtoto ne mfidie a wɔde tutu fam ho asɛm yie
To address the problem, Dr. Afriyie suggested that excavators be accounted for and banned.	Dr. Afrieyie kyerɛɛ sɛ yɛbɛtumi asi ɔhaw no ano kwan berɛ a yɛrehu mfidie a wɔde tutu fam no nyinaa ano na wɔasi ne dwumadie ano kwan.

Decommission some of them, sell some of them off and then put a ban on some of them and by attrition get the numbers that we can use for small scale mining,” he added further.	ɔsan ka kaa ho sɛ, yɛmfa bi ngu dan mu, yɛntɔn bi na yɛmfa ɔhyɛ nto bi so na yɛnte ebi ahoɔden so na yɛnnya deɛ yɛde bɛtu fɔm agudie.

In addition, he said the current generation of Ghanaians was not entitled to all the mineral resources thus, the overall act of mining should be regulated.	Bio, ɔsane kaa sɛ, ɛnɛ Ghanafoɔ nni tumi wɔ ɛfam agudie so, ɛne sɛ ɛwɔ sɛ yɛde mmara to ɛfam agudie a yɛtuo ho.

A former Member of Parliament (MP) for the Bantama constituency and the Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Henry Kokofu has called on the flagbearer of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), John Dramani Mahama to stop politicising galamsey issues in the country.

According to him, President Akufo-Addo has failed in his promise to fix the problems facing small-scale miners in Ghana.	Deɛ ɔreka ne sɛ, ɔmanpanin Akufo Addo adi Ghana hwammɔ wɔ galamsey ko no mu

“I don’t understand the basis for the hypocrisy about the galamsey fight from NDC because it was under their tenure that the activities of galamsay heightened in this country; from 2011, 2012, up to 2014 and leading to 2016.”	Mente saa nyaatwom yi NDCfoɔ kannini yi reyɛ yi ase, galamsey nseɛnsɛm yi hyɛɛ aseɛ wɔ w’aberɛ so a na ɛyɛ 2011, 2012 a de bɛsi 2014 na ɛde bɛwuraa 2016.

“This a waste of time. It is not the answer to the problem,” he added.	Wei yɛ mmerɛ sɛe ara kwa, ɛntumi ɛnsi yɛn haw ano kwan
These reported plans accompanied reports that the government will from March 2020 withdraw the military component of its anti-illegal mining taskforce, Operation Vanguard, from the field.

To continue effective monitoring of the sector, Citi News sources said the government was going to rely on mining guards and 144 drone pilots who are under the Nation Builders Corps.

Findings by some lecturers in the Political Science Department of the University of Ghana cited the fight against illegal mining as the second most disliked government policy.

The drones are used to take live images in districts where the practice is rampant.	Wɔde durones yi twa mfoni wɔ mansin ahodoɔ a wɔyɛ saa nnwuma yi pa ara.

ASEPA had said recent allegations of corruption in the fight against illegal mining “show that the whole fight against illegal mining was a sham and a plot to get licensed small scale miners out of business so that some elements in the government can take over small scale mining in the country.”	ASEPA aka sɛ kwadu a ɛfa kataasehyɛ ne porɔeɛɛ ho no nyinaa yɛ deɛ ɛrekɔ so wɔ galamsey ko a ɔman no reko tia no na aboa ama wɔn a wɔreyɛ saa nnwuma ahorow no nyinaa anya krataa mapa a edi adanseɛ sɛ ampa yɛama wɔn ho kwan sɛ wɔnnye adwuma no na aboa ama aban no nso atumi any biribi afi mu.

Kennedy Agyapong had alleged that some mining excavators seized by the government from alleged illegal miners had been given to Jojo Frimpong-Boateng through Ekow Ewusi who is currently being held by police over the disappearance of seized excavators.

The Minister in the interview also denied any involvement in alleged corruption in the fight against illegal mining.	ɔsoafoɔ no nso annye saa kwadu no mu biara antom.
“Everything that I have done in this world is for Ghanaians.	Biribi biara a mayɛ wɔ wiase mu ha yi, meyɛɛ maa Ghanafoɔ.

There have been calls for him to resign or be axed during the aftermath of revelations about the disappearance of hundreds of excavators seized from illegal miners.	ɔfrɛ pii no ara na wanya sɛ anka ɔmfa n’adwuma nto hɔ, ɛnam mfidie a wɔde tutu fam bɛyɛ ɔha a ayera no nti.

However, the Minister remained resolute when queried on the matter insisting that the state will get to the bottom of the controversy.	Nanso ɔsoafo yi gyinaa ne nan so, berɛ a na wɔrebisabisa ho nsɛm na ɔman no pɛ sɛ ohu biribiara a ɛwɔ asɛm no mu.

The sector minister who has come under serious attack from a section of the public over his inability to account for all the equipment seized from illegal miners said he is confident that every stolen equipment will be found.	ɔsoafoɔ yi a nnipa pii no ara ato wɔn ano agu ne so yi ɛnam sɛ ontumi nkyerɛ nneɛma a ɔgyegye firii wɔn a wɔnnam kwan pa so retu fam agudie afa nti no, ɔde gye die ne ɔpɛ pa kaa sɛ nneɛma no a, ayera no wɔbɛhunu.

The opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) had said that the government’s ban on small scale mining was only a “smokescreen” to kick out other miners and allow persons aligned to the NPP space to mine clandestinely whilst the ban was still in force.

Jojo Frimpong-Boateng, son of the Minister is amongst those accused of being involved in illegal mining and using a missing excavator for the act in some of the country’s forest reserves.	ɛoɛo Frimpong-Boateng, ɔsoafo yi ba yi ka wɔn a wɔyɛ galamsey adwuma yi bi no ho na wɔasan asesa mfidie a wɔde tutu fam a aban no gyee no de akɔ Ghana kwae a ɔrebɔ ho ban no mu de kɔyɛ adwuma.
But the Minister said the allegation against his son is false.	Nanso ɔsoafoɔ no kaa sɛ, ɛnyɛ nokware.

Meanwhile, the suspended First Vice-Chairman of the NPP in the Central Region, Horace Ekow Ewusi who has become the centre of the controversial issue of the missing equipment has been captured in a viral video allegedly claiming that he together with the NPP General Secretary, Boadu were tasked by the sector minister to use the seized excavators to mine in various concessions.

John Boadu subsequently denied the allegation.	John Boadu annye saa nsɛm yi anto mu.
Prof. Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng had petitioned the Criminal Investigations Department of the Ghana Police Service to investigate Horace Ekow Ewusi over his alleged involvement in the missing earth-moving equipment.

President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has renewed his commitment to tackling the issue of illegal small scale mining popularly referred to as ‘galamsey’ in the country.	ɔmanpanin Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo ahyɛ ne bɔhyɛ a ɔde reko atia galamsey so sa no mu kena wɔ ɔman yi mu.
Delivering the State of the Nation Address in Parliament on Thursday, the President indicated that government still stands by its position to use all available means to address the galamsey menace which continues to destroy large portions of the country’s vegetation cover and water resources.	ɔmapaninAkufo Addo de ɔman no ho nsɛm reto gua no, ɔkyerɛɛ sɛ, ɔbɛkɔ so ayɛ deɛ ɔbɛtumi biara de abɔ yɛn nsaase ho ban afiri galamseyfoɔ a wɔgu so resɛe yɛn nsaase ne yɛn mfudeɛ ahodoɔ no nyinaa.
This comes at a time when many have taken on the government for what they consider as government’s failure to deal with the menace as promised in the run-up to the 2016 general elections.	ɔkaa eyi, ɛnam bɔhyɛ a ɔhyɛe berɛ a ɔrebɔ ntoa wɔ afe 2016 sɛ wɔnto aba mma no no na sɛ ɔba a, deɛ aban dadaa no antumi anyɛ amfa ansi Galamsey kwan no ɔbɛba abɛyɛ
While commending the efforts of the media coalition against galamsey and the Inter-ministerial Committee against Illegal Mining, Nana Addo mentioned that he will ensure that no one in government neglects his or her responsibility in the fight to protect Ghana’s environment.	Berɛ a na ɔrebɔ nsɛntwerɛfoɔ adwuma no aba so wɔ de a wɔde wɔn ho agye ɔko a ɔman no reko atia galamsey no, Nana Addo kaa sɛ, obibiara nni hɔ a ɔbɛyi no tokyene sɛ ɔbɛboa ama yɛatu galamsey so sa na atumi abɔ Ghana nsaase ho ban.
“When we came into office in January 2017, galamsey activities were rampant in many parts of the country. Our lands, forests and river bodies were being systematically degraded and destroyed without any care and this had been the case for several years.	Berɛ a yɛbaa aban mu ɔpɛpɔn, 2017 no, na galamsey adwuma no agye nsam wɔ ɔman no mmeaɛ pii no ara. Yɛn nsaase, yɛn kwae ne nsubontene ahodoɔ nyinaa no na asɛesɛe yɛmpɛɛ ɔkwan papa biara mfa mfaa so.

“I was cheered by the support of the large population that recognized the dangers posed by the degradation of our lands and water bodies and the needless deaths of many young people who were buried alive in makeshift mining pits.

In the past week, the NDC has described the government’s fight against galamsey as a failure because of several actions by government appointees and the issue of missing seized equipment.

Already, various bodies have called on the government to provide details on the progress or otherwise made on the fight against galamsey, with the NDC, demanding for a public exhibition of the seized excavators.

In light of the above, we need to do some introspection of how the crusade against illegal small scale mining began, take a look at some of the gains made and how things started falling apart three years down the line.	ɛnam deɛ yɛaka wɔ soro no nti no, ɛsɛ sɛ yɛhwɛ ɔkwan ahodoɔ a yɛfaa so sɛ yɛde reko atia galamsey no hyɛɛ aseɛ, baabi a akɔ akodu, ne deɛ atumi afiri mu aba, sɛdeɛ ɛhyɛɛ aseɛ, na mfehyia mmiɛnsa a atwam yi no sɛn na abɛdu.

All registered small-scale miners whose licenses were operational as at April 1, 2017, were to submit all relevant documentation to the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM) Secretariat, before Friday, September 7, 2018.

Another group GalamSTOP Taskforce was commissioned by IMCIM on 29th September, 2019 to augment activities of Operation Vanguard.	Agyinatukuon san yii kuo foforo a na wɔfrɛ wɔn GalamStop ɛbɔ 29, 2019 sɛ wɔmmɛboa Operation Vanguard adwuma no.

The IMCIM Secretariat also procured drones to monitor activities of illegal miners, especially in the forest reserves.	ɔtwerɛtwerɛni a na ɔda saa kuo yi ano kraa durones sɛ ɛmmra na wɔmfa nhwehwɛ wɔn a wɔregu so yɛ amenamutu adwuma no a ɛnam mmara kwan so ne titiriw ne wɔn a wɔwɔ kwae no mu.
My checks with the IMCIM indicate that a total of 144 drone pilots from the Nation’s Builders Corps, were trained. 10 of the trainees were assigned to IMCIM, 18 for Operation Vanguard and 15 for the Minerals Commission.

As of 2019, Operation Vanguard had arrested about 2,000 illegal Miners with Chinese and Ghanaians being the worst culprits.	ɛbɛsi 2019 no mu no, na Operation Vanguardfoɔ akye amenamutufoɔ yi bɛyɛ 2,000 a emu bi yɛ Chinesefoɔ ɛnna dodoɔ no ara yɛ Ghanafoɔ
At the peak of the campaign, there were reported cases of water bodies returning to their natural states.	ɛnam nnyegyina mu ahodoɔ nti no, nteyɛe bae sɛ nsuo no resi ne dada mu
The government also introduced the community mining project in 2019, to streamline mining for interested indigenes in mining areas.	Aban no nso de nkurowtoa amenamutuo adwuma baa 2019 no sɛnea ɛbɛboa kurow mma a wɔn ani gye amenamutuo adwuma no ho no.
On the back of these gains, the Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, scored their achievement at 70 percent.	ɔhwɛ nea woatumi ayɛ afa amenamutuo adwuma a ɛmfa mmara kwan so no a, otitenani no maa adwuma sononko a agyinatukuo no, ayɛ no ɔha mu nkyekyɛ mu aduoson

The secretary of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, Charles Bissue, for instance, was implicated in a documentary allegedly taking a bribe to aid the issuance of mining license	ɔtwerɛfo a ɔda agyinatukuo no ano no, Charles Bissue sei, wɔhuu no wɔ nyɛe bi mu sɛ ɔregye adaamudeɛ ama obi nkrataa de akɔyɛ amenamutu adwuma no.
He has since stepped down from his role as Secretary to the Committee.	ɛmaa no de n’adwuma too hɔ sɛ agyinatukuo no twerɛfoɔ
He was cleared of the allegations by the Criminal Investigations Department.	ɔriminal Investigations Departmentfoɔ akyerɛ sɛ kwadu no a yɛde abɔ no no ne ho nnim
But the Special Prosecutor arm of the investigations is still ongoing albeit slow.	Nanso aban kwantenkoro mmaranimni no deɛ ɔgu so reyɛ ne nhwehwɛmu no mmom deɛ ɛnkɔ ɔhare so
There have been allegations of bribery and extortion against members of Operation Vanguard.	Yɛde kwadu abɔ Operation Vanguardfoɔ no sɛ woregyegye sika
This is seriously affecting their operations.	Eyi redi dwumadie no nya pa ara
Forestry Commission officials have also stated on record that some powerful politicians are behind the illegal small scale mining enterprise, making it practically difficult for them to enforce the law.	Forestry Commissionfoɔ nso de abɛto dwa sɛ, amanyɔfoɔ bi hyɛ saa amenamu dwuma yi ase a ɛnam so ama ne ko no ayɛ den.
The slow pace of prosecution of arrested illegal miners is also worsening matters.	ɔkwan a wɔfa di amenamutufoɔ yi a wɔakye wɔn asɛm wɔ asɛnnibea ahorow no nso resɛe asɛm no koraa, asɛnnie no nkɔ ntɛm
The latest in the twist of events, is the case of the missing excavators.	Deɛ ɛsan bɛsɛe nneɛma koraa yɛ mfidie a wɔde tutu fam a nansa yi ara ayera no
The Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM), Prof. Frimpong Boateng alleged that some seized excavators have gone missing.	Otitenani a ɔda agyinatukuo no ano, Prof. Frimpong Boateng kyerɛ sɛ, mfidie a wɔde tutu fam a wɔgyee no ayera.
During the peak of the crusade between 2017 and 2019, about five hundred excavators were seized from illegal miners.	Berɛ a na dwumadie no rekɔ so wɔ afe 2017 ne 2019 ntam no, wɔgyee mfidie a wɔde tutu fam ahanum firii amenamutufoɔ yi a ɔnam mmara kwan so yi.
They were to be kept in the custody of the police by law.	Wɔde kosii apolisifoɔ atenabea sɛdeɛ mmara kyerɛ no.
In Ghana’s mining laws all seized or confiscated item should be supervised by state security agencies like the police, military or immigration.	ɔman Ghana mu no, mmara a ɛbɔ amenamutu adwuma no ho ban kyerɛ sɛ nneɛma a yɛbɛgye afiri wɔn nsam no, ɛsɛ sɛ apolisifoɔ, asraafoɔ anaa wɔn a wɔbɔ ɔman no ahyɛɛ ho ban na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔhwɛ so.
Reports of the disappearance of the excavators and the subsequent arrest of an official of IMCIM, who is also the suspended Central regional NPP vice-chairman, Horace Ekow Ewusi and six others beg for answers.

Another mind-boggling announcement by the small scale miners was that the ounces of gold seized by IMCIM at the period are also missing.	Adeɛ baako bio a na ɛkyere adwene koraa nso ne sɛ, sikafuturo ahorow a wɔgye firii amenamutufoɔ no hɔ nyinaa nso ayera.
These are serious allegations President Akufo-Addo must investigate if he really meant putting his job on the line. Mind you the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM) is directly under the Presidency.

As a mining reporter who has followed and reported on mining issues, I now understand why many at the time said the formation of the IMCIM was counter-productive.

Its Secretary, Charles Bissue has been implicated for allegedly taking bribes.	Kuo no twerɛtwerɛfoɔ no, Charles Bissue, wɔahu sɛ wɔregye adaamudeɛ.
He is still being investigated by the Office of the Special Prosecutor.	Aban kwantenkoro mmaranimni no reyɛ ne nsɛm no ho nhwehwɛmu.
Its Chairman, Professor Frimpong Boateng has also been caught on tape in a conversation that seems to suggest he had and his party sought to privately profit from the confiscation of the excavators to fund their political party’s activities.

That is scandalous, to say the least.	Eyi yɛ korɔno bɔ anakasa.
The cost of an excavator ranges between 270,000 USD and 320,000 USD.	Exkaveita boɔ ne nam 270,000 USD ne 320,000 USD

While this may not be enough, there is clearly some capacity at the Minerals Commission and with their institutional understanding of the mining space, they are better placed to take over from the IMCIM.	ɛwom sɛ ebia na ngudeɛ asoeɛ no antumi deɛ, nanso wɔn nimdeɛ ne ntease a wɔwɔ fa amenamutu adwuma no ho no bɛboa ama wɔatumi asi agyinatukuo no anan mu.
After the dissolution of IMCIM, innovations like Galamstop, the drones and the numerous vehicles should be given to the Minerals Commission to bolster their resources and strengthen their hand to enable them do a superior job.

Alhassan Suhuyini, on the Floor of Parliament on Tuesday, said: “His Excellency the President who boldly put his Presidency on the line to demonstrate how much this course meant to him, if for nothing at all, Mr. Speaker, has his Presidency to save and it will be important that he starts by accounting for and to the people of Ghana all equipment, vehicles, weapons, ammunition and gold which were seized and kept by officers he commissioned to help end illegal mining and if necessary, penalize all who have proven to be negligent or complicit in what may have gone wrong.”	Benada no, berɛ a Alhassan Suhuyini suree sɛ ɔrekasa wɔ mmarahyɛbadwamu no, ɔkyerɛɛ sɛ ɔmanpanin a wɔayɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔde ne manpanyindie no bɛko atia galamsey adwuma no, anka ɔmanpanin bɛma Ghanafoɔ nyinaa ahunu nneɛma ahodoɔ a wagyeɛ, ɛyɛ lɔɔre, akodeɛ, ne sikafuturo ahodoɔ nyinaa a wɔn a wɔyii wɔn sɛ wɔnkɔko no agyeɛ sɛdeɛ ɛbɛyɛ na yɛbɛhu baabi a emu biara wɔ.

The missing excavators brouhaha began when Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng, the Minister for Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation and also Chairperson for the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM), disclosed recently that some of the excavators which were seized from illegal miners between 2017 and 2018 had vanished.	mfidie a wɔde tutu fam yi a ayera yi ho nsɛnsɛm yi hyɛɛ aseɛ berɛ a Professor Kwabena Frimpong Boateng, ɔsoafo a ɔhwɛ Nsaase, abɔdeɛmunyansapɛ, mfidie ne mpontuo so a ɔno ara san ne agyinatukuo no nnaanoni kaa sɛ mfidie a wɔde tutu fam bi a wɔgyee no 2017 ne 2018 no ayera.

The Shama District might not have galamsey activities ongoing along the Pra River, but the hidden operations of illegal gold miners around Daboase in the Wassa East District and beyond have resulted in the brownish colour of the Pra River, posing a danger to communities who depend on the river for water.

The Bosomdo D/A Primary School’s kindergarten is facing a severe shortage of teachers due to the water supply problem, while Primaries one to six, which under normal circumstances, must have a minimum of six teachers, have only four teachers including the headmaster as most teachers are unwilling to stay in the community.

President of the Association, Davis Narh Korboe speaking at a meeting with President Nana Akufo-Addo at the Jubilee House said the practice is unfavourable to the growth of the cocoa industry.

“For instance, cocoa farms are being cut down every now and then and what we are saying is that in as much as people want to make money from mining, then concession, we should look at prime cocoa and exclude them from these mining activities so that our farmers can really produce,” he said.	ɛnɛ sɛ wɔretwa kookoo mfuo no gu, ɛnam sɛ nnipa pii no ara pɛ sɛ wɔnya sika firi amenamutu adwuma no mu nti. ɛsɛ sɛ yɛgye kookoo no ho mfasoɔ na yɛtwe yɛnho firi amenamutu adwuma no ho na yɛtumi dua kookoo no bebree

The leader of the Special Team set up by the Inter-Ministerial Committee on illegal mining to monitor, investigate, evacuate and arrest persons involved in illegal mining, Nana Yaw Boadu, had earlier stated that the team will expeditiously investigate and make sure that everyone involved in illegal mining is brought to book as it probes the issue of the missing excavators.

It will be recalled that at the peak of the fight against illegal mining between 2017 and 2018, about 500 earth-moving machines were seized by the Lands and Natural Resources Ministry.

Speaking on the Point of View on Wednesday, he called on the government to bring all cases related to the missing excavators to the capital, Accra to be prosecuted so the utmost focus can be given to the case.

A former Minerals Commission Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Dr. Tony Aubynn, says the fight against illegal mining in the last few years has clearly been lost.	Onipa a na kanee no ɔda, ngudeɛ asoeɛ ano no, Dr. Tony Aubynn kyerɛɛ sɛ, galamsey koɔ no atɔ nsuo mu
“Have water bodies become clean? No. Have people stopped mining without the requisite licenses? No. It has even gone underground,” he remarked on Eyewitness News.	Nsuo ani ayɛ fɛ? Dabi. Nnipa retu galamsey no berɛ a wɔkura nkrataa a ɛma wɔn kwan? No. ɛkɔ asaase no ase mpo.
According to Dr. Aubynn, the metrics of success are clear when judging the compliance with the law and the state of the water bodies.	Dr. Aubynn, kyerɛɛ sɛ nsusudua no da hɔ fann, ɛnne sɛ yɛbɛhwɛ sɛ nnipa redi mmara no so anaa mpo no nsuo no ani ate anaa

Dr. Aubynn was on his way out of the Minerals Commission, in 2017, just as the fight against illegal mining was kicking into gear.	Na Dr. Aubynn, bɛfiri Minerals ɔommision 2017 ɛnna saa galamsey ko yi hyɛɛ aseɛ
But at that time, he was confident that illegal small-scale mining, popularly known as galamsey, had stopped in the country following the intense media campaign and government action.

Perhaps not what he meant to communicate as he will later clarify, but the baggage it conveys leaves me with no option than to steer away from it completely.	Ne nyinaa ne sɛ deɛ ɔkaa no sɛ akyire ɔbɛkyerɛ mu yie anaasɛ, anaasɛ adwene a ɛtaa akyire no nti no ɛsɛ sɛ metwe me ho firi ho koraa
Corruption has stayed with us from generations and its impact on our lives have been dire.	Kataahyese ne yɛn atena firi tete na anya nsunsuansoɔ binom wɔ yɛn abrabɔ so.
Corruption at any level should not be tolerated but that seems not the case in the system we live in.	Kataahyese biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛsosɔ so nanso yɛn man yi mu deɛ, yɛnhu no saa koraa
Greasing of palms and handing down cash or kind has gained notoriety in our politics, our public and civil services, our judiciary, our education system and virtually every aspect of our lives.

The consequences of widespread corruption have a horrible effect on our country’s development. Ghana’s developmental agenda has delayed partly because of corruption over the years.	Nsunsuanso bɔne a kataasehyɛ ne porɔeɛɛ renya wɔ ɔman yi mpontuo so no nyɛ asɛm ketewa a ɛnam saa ama ɔman yi ntumi ntu mpon
Imagine monies meant for development syphoned by greedy public and civil servants through contracts and as a result, a community lacking basic social amenity such as water.	Wo ara hwɛ sɛ, sika a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde yɛ ɔman no adwuma no bi kodi nkurɔfoɔ nsɛm na ɛnam kɔnterate nti na nsuo kɛkɛ nnipa nnya bi nnom.

It is therefore not surprising the premium that is placed on the fight against corruption by the various political parties in their campaigns over the years, except to say that, they have failed abysmally at dealing with the canker.	Eyi mma no nyɛ nwanwa deɛ nti dawubɔ ne nneɛma ahodoɔ a amamnyɔkuo ahodoɔ a wɔwɔ ɔman no mu reyɛ de ako atia galamsey no nyinaa atɔ nsuo mu no
Government after the other since 1992 has promised to deal ruthlessly with corruption but the result after the promises leave much to be desired.	Aban no hyɛɛ bɔ ɛfiri 1992 sɛ ɔbɛko atia kataasehyɛ nanso yɛnhuu nsunsuansoɔ mapa biara atumi afiri mu aba
The setting-up of the Office of Special Prosecutor (OSP) by the NPP led Government was considered as a game-changer in the nation’s fight against the menace, but three years into its existence, little has been seen.	ɛnam saa nti na yɛhu no sɛ aban kwantenkoro ɔfese a NPP aban no bɛbuee no bɛboaa ama anka yɛatumi asi kataasehyɛ ano kwan nanso no ade papa biara mpo antumi amfiri mu amma
The man put in charge of that office was an honourable, effective and efficient man, but that perhaps was when he was a private citizen.	Onipa a yɛde no too saa beaɛ no ano no yɛ deɛ odi ne ho ni, ɔpɛ adwuma na onim n’adwuma nanso sɛ na ɔte saa berɛ a na onni aban mu no
Maybe we should have left him as a ‘citizen vigilante’, by now we will have recovered the ‘Woyome’ money and many others.	Anaa anka ɛsɛ sɛ yɛgyae no na anka ɔyɛ ‘Citizen vigilante’, anka saa berɛ yi deɛ anka watumi agye Woyome sika no ne afoforo bi deɛ nyinaa
This by no means seeks to ridicule the office, maybe we will be reaping the fruits soon, but three years of ‘no show’, leaves me worried.	Eyi nso nkyerɛ sɛ, ɛsɛ sɛ yɛtwee twee ɔfese no, ebia na afei na ɔrebɛyɛ adwuma, nanso mfeɛ mmiɛnsa yi a yɛanhu hwee, ɛnna ɛma medi abooboo
Perhaps the political chess game we play with the fight against bribery, exploitation and sleaze in our political and public services has not helped.	Ebi nso a amanyɔsɛm a yɛde awurawura kataasehyɛ ko a yɛreko wɔ ɔman no mu no nso na ɛmmoa ɔman no wɔ kwan biara so
Corruption fight is a non-negotiable matter in the interest of our country.	Kataasehyɛ ho nsɛm yɛ adeɛ enni kwan sɛ yɛtoto n’ase koraa wɔ ɔman yi mu koraa
But this is not an act only politicians and people in high authority engage in, private citizens and individuals are equal culprits when it comes to corruption.

Remember, ‘the giver and the taker’ are both guilty?	Mma wo werɛ mfiri sɛ deɛ ɔde rema ne deɛ ɔregye nyinaa ayɛ bɔne
We have perhaps become numb as a people to the corruption that we are willing to pay each time even without request.	Asɛ yɛbɛyɛ kataasehyɛ ho anomaa konkonene a abere biara no yɛpɛ sɛ yɛtua berɛ mpo a wɔmmisa yɛn
Our national consciousness about corruption fight seem narrow and therefore need to be deepened.	ɔman no aman a wɔretu de ako atia kataasehyɛ no, mehu no sɛ yɛwɔ ani dodow ɛsɛ sɛ yɛpagya mu kakra
Our understanding of what constitutes corruption is blurred hence our pride in the act.	Yɛn tease a yɛwɔ fa kataasehyɛ ho no wɔ fam ɛno nti ɛma nneyɛe bi wɔ hɔ a yɛgye tom
Lest I deviate, the war against illegal mining is rearing its ugly head again, our water bodies are turning brown, water treatment plants are about shutting down.	Gye sɛ yɛgyae, ɔko a yɛreko atia galamsey no ɛsan atɔ nsuo mu bio, yɛn suo no ani redan kɔkɔɔ, mfidie a yɛde te nsuo no ani no resɛe
The ongoing illegal mining activities, popularly known as ‘galamsey’ affirms my position that maybe we have become numb to corruption or we are willing to be complicit in it.	Amenamutu adwuma yi a ɛnnam mmara kwan so yi a yɛsan frɛ no Galamsey yi a ɛrekɔ so yi, mehu no sɛ ɛyɛ kataasehyɛ nti na ɛgu so kɔ so no anaasɛ yɛn ara agye atom sɛ yɛne no bɛtena.
The long-held notion that ‘when the last tree dies, the last man dies’ has perhaps become an over flogged cliché that doesn’t strike to the core anymore.	Ayɛ sɛ asɛm a yɛka no daa sɛ, daa dua a aka wɔ wiase no bɛwu no, nipa wɔaka no nso bɛwu no ɛno na ɛmma yɛnhu sɛnti no bio no
The media coalition against ‘galamsey’ along with government, fought the canker to some extent but the battle is far from over.	Nsɛntwerɛfoɔ ne aban no kaa wɔn ntoma paa ano sɛ wɔde reko atia galamsey no, wɔyɛɛ adeɛ nanso ankɔ si aga.
The fight against ‘galamsey’ is imperative that needs no apathetic approach.	Galamsey ko no yɛ deɛ ɛhia pa ara a ɛnni kwan sɛ yɛtoto no ase koraa.
We are losing our forest cover and losing our water bodies as well.	Yɛn kwae ne yɛn nsuo ahodoɔ nyinaa resɛe
A recent publication about water shortage hitting part of the central region, Cape Coast to be specific struck me to the core.	Nansa yi ara nsuo a ɛho akɔ atwee wɔ mfinimfini mantam mu no, ɔape ɔoast no kyerɛ me sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ yɛsɔre
The publication suggests that the activities of illegal mining are leaving the water treatment plant in the region with no option than to ration water which in the long run will lead to a total shut-down.

I ask then, are we losing the fight against ‘galamsey’ too? I hope not.	Nti mebisa sɛ, ɔko a yɛreko atia galamsey no yɛredi nkoguo anaa? Megye di
Because, ‘when the last water dries, the last man dies too’.	ɛfiri sɛ, nsuo a ɛbɛka akyiri no nyinaa we a, nipa a waka no nso bɛwu
It is perhaps overstretched, but I likened the effect of galamsey on corruption.	Ayɛ sɛ mereka no dodo nanso mede galamsey nsunsuansoɔ no nyinaa bɛhyɛ kataasehyɛ
They are both cancerous tissues that need to be dealt with, but we seem to be losing both fights.	Ne mmienu nyinaa yɛ adeɛ a a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛko tia nanso ɛyɛ me sɛ yɛredi nkoguo
President Akufo-Addo led administration ‘tried’ fighting the menace but it seems ‘galamsey’ is rather fighting it.	ɔmanpanin Akufo Addo yɛe sɛ ɔreko saa ɔhaw yi nanso mehu no sɛ galamsey mmom na ɔne yɛn reko
Bodies such as GalamStop, Inter-Ministerial body, and other operations were launched to fight against corruption but none so far appears to have helped completely.	Yɛtetee kuo ahodoɔ bi te sɛ GalamStop, asoeɛasoeɛ agyinatukuo, Operations akuo ahodoɔ sɛ wɔmmɛko ntia kataasehyɛ nanso emmu biara antu annyina
The approach helped to some extent but our water bodies are still at the mercies of the cruel individuals who are bent on making money at the expense of the national good.	ɔkwan yi boaeɛ kakra nanso yɛn nsuo ani te sɛ deɛ ɛte no ara ɛnam ankorɛankorɛ bi sika a ɔpɛ no nti no ɔman no nyinaa mmɔ
Some of the bodies set up to fight ‘galamsey’ have allegedly degenerated into extortion bodies, taking kickbacks and bribes at the expense of our country.	Ekuo ahodoɔ a yɛyii wɔn sɛ ɔmmɛko ntia galamsey no adan sika gyegye kuo a ɔnam ɔman no ho regye adaamudeɛ
While citizens are complicit in these acts as their role in fronting for foreign nationals smacks in the face for good citizenship, these multi-million ventures are sponsored by people in authority and well to do in society- people who have no good intentions for Ghana.

The adoption of technology in the fight was announced in 2018 but we seem to have gone to bed after the declaration just like others.

Lands and Natural Resources Minister, Mr Asomah-Cheremeh stated in September 2019 that, the government has achieved 85% success rate in the fight against ‘‘galamsey’’.	ɔsoafoɔ a ɔhwɛ nsaase ne agudeɛ soɔ no, Mr. Asomah-ɔheremeh kaa no ɛbɔ 2019 mu sɛ, aban no atumi adu ɔha mu nkyekyɛ mu aduɔwɔtwe num ho wɔ ɔko a ɔreko galamsey no
While no evidence was given to substantiate this claim, I have no reason to doubt except to say, our rivers are still brown, indicating there is ‘galamsey’ still on-going.

The Mineral and Mining Law has been amended with 15years minimum and 25years Maximum sentences, as well as 10,000 and 15,000 penalty units to ensure stiffer punishment but the recalcitrant are still doing it, perhaps with a planned cabal.

At the Meet-The-Press by the Lands and Natural resource minister, mining contributed $1.3 billion in 2019 as revenue, creating over 26,425 jobs by the large scale mining firms.

The potential at the mining industry remains a viable one which when harnessed properly and through the legal channel will add a substantial amount to our revenue basket. But at no point should ‘galamsey’ be regularized since the result on the nation will be a disaster.

Galamsey and Corruption have an awful consequence on our country’s development and the earlier we deal with them with all seriousness, the best it will be for generations yet unborn.	Galamsey ne kataahyɛ wɔ nsunsuansoɔ bɔne wɔ yɛn man yi mpontuo so, na sɛ yɛtumi so ano ntɛm de a, ɛbɛboa yɛn pa ara

It appears the about 500 excavators seized during the intense crusade against illegal small scale mining between 2017 and 2018, are not missing as alleged by the Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, Professor Frimpong Boateng.

Many rivers, including the Birim River in the Eastern Region and other water bodies, that take their source from these forests have as a result been left heavily polluted, depriving residents in nearby communities of a source of freshwater and putting at risk the lives of over five million other people in major cities in the south whose potable water are sourced from the forests.

In the report, it was found that although the forestry commission makes some arrest and ensures prosecution of persons who mine illegally in forest reserves, some of those who cause the worst destructions are able to escape prosecution or sometimes arrest due to the influence of powerful people in society.

According to the lawyers, the presence of the first Prosecution Witness, Nii Dodoo does not qualify him to testify because he was appointed Receiver of uniBank after being a partner of KPMG which audited the accounts of the bank.

Justice Bright Mensah, Court of Appeal Judge, sitting as an additional High Court Judge, said, ” I uphold the argument of DPP that the appointment was not illegal or void.

The appointment of Nii Dodoo by BoG is valid.”	Faa a ɔfaa no no nam mmara kwan so
He said Section 59 of the Evidence Act explained who was not qualified to testify, which included someone who was incapable of coherent expression so as to be understood, directly or through interpretation by another person who could understand that person; or incapable of understanding the duty of a witness to tell the truth.	ɔkaa sɛ, section 59 of the Evidence Act no kyerɛ onipa a ɔntumi nni adanseɛ wɔ asɛnnibea, a ɛyɛ obi a kasa ho yɛ no den, anaasɛ ɔkasa a nnipa nte aseɛ papa anaasɛ ɔhia obi a ɔte ɔno nko ara asɛm ase, anaa ɔnte sɛdeɛ yɛdi adanseɛ wɔ asɛnnibea no ase.

“The appointment of the Receiver was valid,” he added.	ɔka kaa ho sɛ, ɔfa a ɔfaa no no no no nam mmara kwan so
He, however, said the Counsel for A1, A2 and A4 had impressed upon the court that, the evidence, he would give would be tainted with illegality because he was incapable to testify on those reports.	ɔsan kaa bio sɛ A1, A2 ne A4 ama asɛnnibea no ahu sɛ adanseɛ a wɔrebɛdi no deɛ ɛnteɛ bi frafra mu ɛnam sɛ wɔantumi anka hwee amfa anodisɛm a ɛbaa no ho
The Judge said that the argument was simplistic and that it could not be said that the method would be tainted with invalidity.	ɔtemmuafoɔ no kaa sɛ, akyinneɛ yi yɛ deɛ emu da hɔ fann, ɛno nti no yɛntumi nka sɛ ɔkwan a yɛrefa so no nneɛma bi a ɛnnyɛ abɛfrafra mu

The Ghana Association of Bankers says it largely welcomes the Bank of Ghana’s directives to banks and Specialized Deposit-Taking institutions to stop a number of fees and charges slapped on customers for some services rendered.

Speaking to Citi News, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Association, John Awuah, justified the charges on savings accounts, explaining that some savings accounts are technically operated like current accounts.

It is, for this reason, we support largely, not entirely, the cancellation of some charges.	ɛnam saa nti na yɛfoa, nyɛ ne nyinaa deɛ na mmom no sɛ wɔntwa saa ntetee no mu

The Central Bank in a statement on Friday, June 18, 2021, directed banks and Specialized Deposit-Taking institutions to desist from implementing seven different fees and charges, and also stop engaging in some practices that do not auger well for the banking sector.

The fees and charges, and practices which are identified by the central bank as unfair include, Credit Insurance Premium Overcharges, Maintenance Fees on Savings Account, among others, Over the Counter (OTC) Withdrawal Charges as well as the requirement by some banks for borrowers to make them part owners in some assets they present for use as collateral for loans.

As part of credit underwriting policies, a number of banks and SDIs require borrowers to hold credit insurance against eventualities such as death, permanent disability, and termination of employment.	ɛnam atoyerɛnkyɛm nti no sikakorabea no hwɛ sɛ ansa na ɔbɛbɔ obi bosea no, na onii no wɔ nsiakyibaa a ɛfa atoyerɛnkyɛm ho sɛ ɛyɛ owuo, dɛ die anaa w’adwuma resɛe
While the Bank of Ghana acknowledges the importance of this practice as a loss mitigating norm in credit management, a number of banks and SDIs take advantage, to overprice the premiums charged to customers, resulting in the increased cost of borrowing.	ɛnam sɛ Bank of Ghana hu no sɛ, saa nhyehyɛe yi boa sɛdeɛ ɛbɛyɛ a sikakorabea ahodoɔ no nneɛma nnye ngu no nti no, sikakorabea no bi afa ho de gye sika binom firi wɔn adwadifoɔ hɔ a ɛrema wɔn bosea a wɔbɔ no kɔ soro pa ara
Banks and SDIs are directed to desist from premium overcharges and to adhere strictly to the following:	Wɔahyɛ sikakorabea ahodoɔ no nyinaa sɛ, wɔntwe wɔn ho mfiri saa nneyɛe no ho na wɔnni saa nhyehyɛe yi so
Banks and SDIs that opt to use their pre-determined insurance companies to underwrite borrowers’ loans, shall apply the same premium charged by the underwriting company to borrowers.

The application of “Account Maintenance Fees” by banks and SDIs on savings accounts inhibits deposit mobilisation and discourages the use of banking systems by the public.	Saa sika yi a ɛyɛ ‘Aɔɔount Maintenanɔe Fees’ yi mma kwan mma adwadifoɔ ne sikakorabea no nni dwa
Bank of Ghana has noted that the application of such fees has driven a number of savings accounts into debt and, in so doing, eroded the deposits of vulnerable depositors who would generally expect their savings accounts to earn interest.

Na ama wɔn nso a wɔdwene sɛ anka wɔde sika bɛto sikakorabea hɔ a ɔbɛnya mfasoɔ wɔ so no nso agyae
This practice is detrimental to financial inclusion and negates the gains of the financial literacy programmes geared towards promoting personal savings.	Saa nneɛma ahodoɔ yi resɛe sikakorabea adwuma no na ɛretwe nkurɔfoɔ firi sika a na anka wɔde sie wɔ sikakorabea ahodoɔ no ho
Bank of Ghana notes that some banks and SDIs impose penal charges on customers who withdraw their own funds from banking halls of affected banks and SDIs.	Bank of Ghana ahu sɛ sikakorabea no bi de ntetee bi ato sika a adwadifoɔ yi firi wɔn ankasa akaunto mu wɔ sikakorabea no mu no
The reason commonly attributed to this practice is to encourage customers to use digital platforms provided by the banks/SDIs for such withdrawals, in order to decongest banking halls.	Deɛ ɔka fa ho nyinaa ne sɛ, ɔde eyi ato hɔ sɛdeɛ nnipa pii no ara mma sikakorabea hɔ mmɛyi sika na mmom no wɔde wɔn foonu ne kaade mmom na ɛbɛyi sika afiri sika korabea ahodoɔ no mu
These digital platforms are however not offered for free.	Saa foonu ne kaade a wɔde yi sika yi nso nyɛ adeɛ a wɔnte wɔn sika kakra mfiri so
While the Bank of Ghana acknowledges the support of banks and SDIs in the digitization agenda, this action deters some customers, especially those who are averse to the use of digital platforms, from opening and operating accounts.	Berɛ Bank of Ghana refoa sikakorabea ahodoɔ no wɔ foonu sikasɛm dwumadie mu no, saa nneyɛe nso ma nnipa binom twe wɔn ho firi akaunto a ɔbɛbue no ho ne titiriw ne wɔn a wɔnnim foonu no mu yie
The practice also negatively affects the financial inclusion drive of the Bank of Ghana.	Saa nneyɛe yi nso nya nsunsuansoɔ bɔne wɔ Bank of Ghana so ɛnam sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔhu nneɛma binom mu nti.
Banks and SDIs are directed to desist from levying penalties on customers who withdraw their own funds below certain thresholds from the banking halls.	Wɔahyɛ sikakorabea no sɛ wɔntwe wɔn ho mfiri ntwatema bi a wɔde to adwadifoɔ so no sɛ wɔyi wɔn ankasa sika na annu deɛ wɔhyɛɛ sɛ wɔbɛyi no a
In addition, banks and SDIs shall not levy penalties against customers who request account balances within banking halls.	Bio, nso no sikakorabea ahodoɔ no, enni kwan sɛ ɔte adwadifoɔ a ɔpɛ sɛ ɔhu sika a ɛda wɔn akaunto mu wɔ sikakorabea hɔ no
Bank of Ghana notes that some banks and SDIs require borrowers who secure credit facilities with movable assets, to transfer ownership of such assets into the joint names of the borrower and the bank or SDI involved.	Bank of Ghana asan ahu sɛ sikakorabea no bi wɔ hɔ a, wɔhwehwɛ sɛ wɔn a wɔrebɛbɔ bosea no de wɔn agyapadeɛ bi ba na wɔsesa yɛ no sɛ, ɛyɛ wɔne sikakorabea no deɛ
In addition, borrowers are made to bear the cost associated with the transfer prior to loan approval and after the settlement of the loan.	Deɛ ɛka ho ne sɛ, deɛ ɔbɛbɔ bosea no na ɔma no na ɔma no bɔ saa ka no ansa na wɔama no sika no
This practice of some banks and SDIs is contrary to section 7 of the Borrowers and Lenders Act, 2020 (Act 1052) which does not permit a security interest to operate as a transfer of title from a borrower to a lender.	Saa nneyɛe yi a sikakorabea no bi dan no adi no ne bosea bɔ mmara a ɛyɛ section 7 ( Borrowers and Lenders Act, 2020 (Act1052ɔ no bɔ abira a ɛmma kwan sɛ deɛ ɔrebɔ bosea no no ne deɛ ɔregye bosea afiri ne hɔ no de wɔn din bɛto n’ade so
The practice further denies borrowers the opportunity to secure multiple loans with single collateral duly registered in the name of the respective borrowers.

Banks and SDIs are barred from engaging in the practice of changing ownership of collaterals presented by borrowers to secure credit facilities from the borrower to the bank or SDI.	Seesei no sikakorabea ahodoɔ no, yɛasi wɔn kwan sɛ wɔne wɔn a wɔrebɛpɛ bosea wɔ wɔn hɔ no de wɔn din bɛto ade ko no ara ɔde bɛsi akagyina mu
The Bank of Ghana has observed a practice among some banks and SDIs, where penal interest rates levied against defaulting loan customers, are made to accrue interest.

In effect, interest is computed on penal charges in addition to interest on the outstanding loan amount.	ɛne sɛ, ntwama yi wɔde ka ntetee a ɛda bosea no so no
This practice results in high outstanding loan balances which customers are unable to pay, resulting in high non-performing loans.	Saa nneyɛe yi kɔwie sɛ, bosea no, adwadifoɔ ntumi ntua a ɛno nti no bosea bɔ ntumi nkɔ so
The practice is detrimental to the credit market.	Saa nneyɛe yi sɛ sɛe adwadie a ɛkɔ so no
Banks and SDIs are directed to desist from the application of interest on penal charges.	Wɔahyɛ sikakorabea ahodoɔ no sɛ wɔntwe wɔn ho mfiri ntwama a wɔama adwadifoɔ tua sɛ berɛ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde tua wɔn sika no boro so no a
Additionally, penal charges shall only be applied on the amount of the delayed interest or principal payment and not on the total outstanding loan amount in accordance with section 55(3) of the Borrowers and Lenders Act, 2020 (Act 1052).	Deɛ ɛteɛ ne sɛ, saa ntwama yi no ɛsɛ sikakorabea no gyeɛ berɛ wɔatwentwen ntwama no tua soɔ anaasɛ sika no ankasa na ɛnyɛ bosea no a ɔbɔɔ yɛ no ho sɛdeɛ bosea bɔ mmara no te no (section 55(3) of the Borrowers and Lenders Act, 2020 (Act1052)
In accordance with section 55 (2) of the Borrowers and Lenders Act, 2020 (Act 1052), banks and SDIs shall impose on a borrower an interest rate that is calculated on an Annual Basis only in all credit agreements.	Sɛ yɛhwɛ boseabɔ mmara no mu a (section 55 (20 of the Borrowers and Lenders Act, 2020 (Act1052) ɛsɛ sɛ sikakorabea no de ntwama bi a ɔgyina sika a ɔregye no afe mu no nyinaa so de biribi asi ho.
Consequently, banks and SDIs are directed to desist from the quotation of monthly interest rates on all credit facilities and associated fees.	Seesei deɛ, wɔahyɛ sikakorabea no sɛ wɔntwe wɔn ho mfiri bosome ntwama a wɔde to bosea so no.
In addition to the interest rate, banks and SDIs are directed to disclose the Annualized Percentage Rate (APR) related to every credit facility in accordance with the Disclosure and Product Transparency Rules for Credit Products and Services.

Bank of Ghana has observed with concern, the lack of compliance with the requirement of banks and SDIs to obtain full personal details (name, address, ID, and telephone numbers) of a person who makes a deposit into or withdrawal from an account on behalf of another person. Deposit slips of some banks and SDIs do not make provision for depositors’ signatures.

Many Ghanaians were hopeful when the government introduced the One District One Factory (1D1F) initiative, which is aimed at building strong value-addition-oriented companies as well as reducing the unemployment rate in the country.

In a bid to address this, the Managing Director of the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB), Dr. John Kofi Mensah, says the bank is offering support to Ghanaians who are into agribusiness by financing out-grower schemes under the one district one factory initiative.	ɛnam saa nti no, onipa a ɔda Agriɔultural Development Bank (ADBɔ ano no, Dr. John Kofi Mensah kae sɛ, sikakorabea no rehwɛ aboa ama Ghanafoɔ a wɔwɔ kuadwumay no mu sika kakra de a de aboa mansin baako mfidi dwuma baako nhyehyɛe no a ɛfa kuadwuma ho no.

The Board Chair of ADB, Alex Bernasko said, although COVID-19 hit various institutions hard, ADB was able to make a profit of 65 million Ghana Cedis in 2020, and even introduced flexible terms to suit its customers.

The Board Chair added that the bank is set to introduce a three-year strategic plan to make it much stronger.	ɔsan nso de too gua sɛ, sikakorabea no san de mfehyia mmieɛnsa nhyɛhyɛe bi asan aba de bɛhyɛ ne nnwuma no mu kena.
“When the COVID-19 pandemic surfaced, we came up with a few strategies to lighten the burden of our customers.	COVID-19 yareɛ no bae no, yɛde nhyehyɛe bi bae bɛtee yɛn adwadifoɔ berɛ so kakra.
In fact, one of them was to introduce a moratorium on existing facilities.	Nokwasɛm ne sɛ, na emu baako yɛ deɛ yɛgyina yɛn akadeɛ ahorow so reyɛ no mmerɛ pɔtee bi mu
Apart from that, some of them were given restructured payment schedule to enable them enough time to pay.	ɛno firi hɔ a, ebi nso deɛ yɛmaa wɔn sikatua no ho mmerɛ ne ɔkwan a ɔbɛfa so atua no na ɛnyɛ asodie mma wɔn
You will also appreciate that some of the charges have been reduced and all that for the benefit of the customers to make life less worrisome for them. But generally, ADB has got a three-year strategic plan which is intended to improve its structures and systems and way of doing work”.

The board members of ADB as part of their visit to the Ashanti Region paid a courtesy call on the Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II.	Nhwɛsokuo a ɔda ADB sikakorabea no nam wɔn nsrahwɛ a wɔkɔɔ no wɔ Asante mantam no mu no so kɔsraa Asantehene, Otumfoɔ ɔsɛe Tutu II
The Asantehene commended the bank for its focus on agriculture and urged it to continue to offer support to various businesses.	Asantehene bɔɔ sikakorabea no abaso wɔn dwuma sononko a wɔredi de boa kuadwuama na ɔsan hyɛɛ wɔn sɛ wɔnkɔ so mmoa nnwuma ahodoɔ no nyinaa.
The Minister for Works and Housing, Francis Asenso Boakye, has disclosed that the government is partnering with the World Bank to invest $200 million in measures to tackle flooding in Accra.	ɔsoafoɔ a ɔhwɛ nnwuma ne afisɛm so, Francis Asenso Boakye, de ato gua sɛ aban no ne Wiase Sikakorbea kɛseɛ (World Bankɔ reka abom de sika botene a ɛyɛ Amɛrika sika ɔpepemhanu abɛhwɛ asi nsuo ahodoɔ a eyiri wɔ Nkran no.
According to him, this forms part of the government’s vision to end the perennial flooding in the capital city.	Deɛ ɔkyerɛ ne sɛ, saa nneɛma yi nyinaa ka aban no tirimpɔ a ɔnam so pɛ sɛ ɔde si nsuo a eyiri afe biara mu wɔ Nkran no.
Mr. Asenso Boakye made this known in a press statement issued on Thursday, June 3, 2021, in commemoration of the June 3 disaster in 2015, which claimed 152 lives and injured many others.	Mr. Asenso Boakye dann yi adi wɔ krataa a ɛkɔ dawubɔfoɔ hɔ no mu Yawda, Ayɛwohumɔmmɔ da a ɛtɔ so mmiɛnsa no mu wɔ afe mpem mmienu ne aduonu baako yi mu de kai deɛ ɛsii afe mpem mmienu ne dunum no mu.
“In line with this, the government has collaborated with the World Bank to invest $200 million to, among others, implement the Greater Accra Resilient and Integrated Development (GARID) project.”	ɛnam eyi nti no, aban no ne Wiase Sikakorabea kɛseɛ (World Bankɔ aka abom de sika botene a ɛyɛ Amɛrika sika ɔpepemhanu de bɛhyɛ Greater Accra Resilient and Integrated Prroject no mu.
The Minister also added that the Akufo-Addo government will also “intensify efforts aimed at finding lasting solutions to the perennial flooding in Accra and other parts of the country.”	ɔsoafoɔ no kyerɛɛ sɛ, Akufo Addo aban bɛkɔ so ayɛ deɛ ɔbɛtumi biara de asi nsu ahodoɔ a eyiri wɔ Nkran ne ɔman no nkurow binom afe biara no.
Meanwhile, Mr. Asenso Boakye also charged the citizenry to aid the government in this endeavour.	ɛnam so maa Mr. Asenso Boakye nso hyɛɛ ɔmanfoɔ nso sɛ wɔmmoa na aban no tirimpɔ yin so ntumi mmra mu
According to him, the government alone cannot end the menace if citizens do not also change their attitudes.	ɔkyerɛɛ sɛ, aban no nko ara ntumi nsi saa ade yi ano kwan, sɛ temanmufoɔ ansesa wɔn suban a.
The project is meant to mitigate flood risks and address the solid waste management challenges in the Odaw Drainage Basin.	Saa dwumadie yi bɛboa ayi nsunsoanso bɔne a nsu yi de ba no afiri hɔ, na asan nso asi efi ne nwura ahodoɔ a ɛwɔ ɔdaw asutene no kwan no mu
It also involves the reconstruction of some bridges to remove identified impediments to the flow of water in the basin when it rains, and the construction of detention ponds upstream of the Odaw Basin, to hold large volumes of water that would otherwise lead to flooding, especially around Kwame Nkrumah Circle.
