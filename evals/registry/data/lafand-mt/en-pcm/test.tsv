As per say na dem gain from di colonial jaguda wey reach a century that time,  dem wan kip all di things wey dem colonial oga fit carry give dem.
They are determined to keep the Muslims in a concentration camp into which the colonial masters drove them.	dem don get am for mind say dem go put muslim pipo inside di place wey colonial dem dem be chase dem put.

Muslims in the region are waking up and asking for freedom.	Muslim pipo wey dey for di region don dey open eye, kom dye ask for freedom.
We demand a halt to the forceful use of Christian school uniform, Christian education, Christian law.	we deamnd say make dem stop as dem dey force us to dey wear christian school uniform, to dey go christian school, to dey use christian law.
We demand civil Shariah, not criminal Shariah that involves the cutting of hands but civil Shariah to regulate Muslim marriages, inheritance, family affairs.	we want shariah wey no dey cut pipo hand, but di shariah wey go dey regulate muslim marriage dem, inherritance and family affair dem.

Ending Nigerias herder-farmer crisis: The Livestock Reform Plan	To end Nigeria herder-farmer kasala: Di Livestock reform Plan
Nigerias federal and state governments are struggling to implement a National Livestock Transformation Plan that seeks to curb the movement of cattle across the country and reduce deadly herder-farmer conflict.	Nigeria federal and state goment dey struggle to implement one National Livestock Transformation Plan wey dey wan use control cattle movement throughout di kontri wey go kom turn to herder and farmer fight
While the Plan has earned the endorsement of many state governments, it faces significant challenges.	Many state goment don endorse am, but e dey face some kind challenge.
Deficient political leadership, popular misperceptions about its purpose, budgetary constraints aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a lack of personnel with the expertise to carry it out and widespread insecurity, are all hindering progress.	Political leadership wey o dey work well, perception about hin purpose wey no korrect, budget constraints wey increase bikos of COVID-19 pandemic,  experts wey no dey to do di work and insecurity wey dey evriwer, dey block di progress
If the Plan fails as previous initiatives to modernise livestock management did, herder-farmer violence could escalate.	If di plan go fail as like di oda plans to modernise livestock management, di farmer and herder fight go increase
Approved by the National Economic Council in January 2019, the Plan represents the most comprehensive effort to overhaul Nigerias inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.	National Economic Council approve am for January 2019, di plan na to represent di effort wey pipo go understand pass to examine di livestock system wey no dey work well
At the core is a strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing, and thus, lower the risk of conflict between herders and farmers.	Di main part of di strategy na to fit kontrol wia grazin dey  apun, so dem go fit reduce di fight wey go wan happen between herders and farmers
It is animated by the hope that over a period of 10 years, predominantly nomadic pastoralists will be persuaded to move their cattle into ranches and public grazing reserves, where breedingg farms and other mechanised livestock management practices are to bolster the sectors productivity.	Di movement get hope say afta 10 years,herders wey dey waka up and down mainly go get mind to dey put dey put dia cattle inside ranch and reserve for public grazin, wia breedin farms and oda mechanised livestock management go support wetin di sector go produce
By the end of 2028, authorities aim to have at least 119 ranches operating in all participating states, creating over two million jobs in the livestock production, processing and marketing chains.	By di time wey 2028 go end, di authority get am for mind to  don build like 119 ranch for all di state wey dey involve, make dem use am create like two million job for di livestock production, processin and market chain
President Muhammadu Buharis administration came up with the Plan following a wave of violence between herders and farmers, particularly a surge in related violence afflicting rural dwellers in 2018.	president Muhammadu Buhari administration na hin make di plan afta one period wia herders and farmers  dey fight,  particilarly wen  di fight to much and he dey affect pipo for ghetto for 2018
The federal government, which has committed to funding 80 per cent of the transformation proposals submitted by participating states, has taken preliminary steps toward putting the Plan into practice, including providing technical support to help states prepare for implementation, such as help with field surveys and site mapping.	Di Federal Goment wey get mind to drop moni wey go carry like 80 percent of di Transformation proposal wey di states wey dey involve submit, don dey take di first step to practice wetin dem plan, wey go include technical support wey go help dem state prepare to start work, tins like field survey and site mappin.
Several states have reactivated earlier demarcated grazing reserves, opened offices and set up steering committees to administer the Plan.	Plenti state don dey reactivate grazin reserve wey dem demarcate, dey open office, dey kom set up steerin committee wey go dey manage di plan join.
Authorities have also held workshops and done other works to explain the benefits of livestock reform to a larger audience.	Di authority dem don dey do workshop and oda work wey dem go use teach pipo di benefit wey livestock reform get
But two years into the 10-year plan, the first new ranch is yet to be built, and the obstacles are many.	As two years don comot for di 10-year plan wey dem do, dey neva build any ranch and dia obstacles plenti
Opposition, partly among herders, predominantly from the Fulani ethnic group but also among farmers who resent the Plans benefits to pastoralists, hinders reform efforts.	opposition wey dey kom from di herders, though na from di Fulani pipo e plenti pass, e kom still dey among di farmers wey no want make pastolist dem enjoy di benefit of di plan sef, dey spoil di reform effort
Distrust is widespread in the Middle Belt, which has been the scene of violent disputes over land between herders and farmers, notwithstanding peacemaking and military efforts that since 2018 have reduced the bloodshed.	Distrust don plenti for Middle belt, place wey be say fight between farmers and herders too plenti bikos of land, even though peacemakin and effort wey di military dey take since 2018 don reduce di blood shed
Federal and state budgets are pinched, partly due to the pandemics economic fallout, and the country lacks sufficient technical expertise for managing ranches and grazing reserves.	Shortage don dey federal and state goment budget, small part na bikos of di economy wey spoil bikos of di pandemic, and bikos di kontri no get technical experts wey know how dem take dey manage ranch and grazin reserve
In many states, especially in the North-West, the proliferation of criminal gangs and other armed groups is cutting off access to grazing reserves and scaring away potential investors.	For many states, especially for North-West, di way wey criminal gang and group dem wey get arm dey grow dey spoil access to grazin reserves and e dey make pipo wey wan invest before no do am again
Unless addressed, these and other problems could delay or even scuttle the Plan, leaving the country vulnerable to an escalation of herder-farmer conflict, which could degenerate into wider ethnic, regional and religious violence.	unless dey do somethin about am, dis kasala and oda ones fit delay or make e spoil di plan, wey go make di kontri dey helpless wen di fight between farmers and herders dey serious pass before own, wey fit kom turn fight between ethnic group, region and religion
Tackling these challenges requires a concerted effort by federal and state authorities, with help from donors and investors.	To tackle dis kasala,e go dey important make Federal and State authority join hand make effort, wit donors and investors help.
First, Abuja and supportive state governments should provide stronger political leadership and improve public communication to dispel misgivings and misperceptions about the Plan.	First, make Abuja and oda states wey dey support am provide political leadership wey strong pass before, make dey kom increase dia communication wit public, so dem go fit spoil pipo doubt and wrong understanding of di plan
These are especially prevalent among pastoralists, who will be asked to change a centuries-old nomadic lifestyle, and who legitimately doubt the Plans promises about available pasture.	Dis one dey common pass for pastoralists dia side, wey go ask dem make dem change dia nomadic lifestlye wey dey wit dia pipo for centuries, wey still get serious doubt say di plan promise about pasture na lie.
But many farmers are fearful too, that they may lose land to livestock producers.	But many farmers dey fear say dem go lose dia land give pipo wey dey produce livestock.
Many in the Middle Belt and southern states remain deeply suspicious of the Plans long-term goals, which they see as creating privileges for herders, and more broadly, the Fulani.	Many pipo for di middle Belt and oda states for di South still dey suspect di plan long-term goals, wey dem dey see as opportunity for herders and di Fulani people particularly
With Abuja and other partners support, state governments must build expertise and technical capacity, especially for managing ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production and meat processing.	Wit di support from Abuja and oda partners, state goments go need find pipo wey go be expert, wey go know technical aspect of thins, especially pipo wey go dey manage di ranch and grazin reserve, dairy production and meat processin
Federal and state governments should also up budgetary commitments, hasten the release of funds and provide financial transparency to ensure accountability, working with donors and investors as necessary.	Make Federal and State goment sef increase dia budget for di plan, release di fund quick and make dey kom create financial transparency to make sure say evrithin dey accounted for, to dey work wit donors and investors wey necessary
Addressing rural insecurity, curbing impunity and rehabilitating communities adversely affected by earlier violence in participating states are also vital.	E dey important sef to dey deal wit insecurities wey dey rural area, to dey curb impunity and to dey kom rehabilitate communities wey di fight affect seriously for di states wey dey participate.
Plus, authorities will need to consider climate changes likely impact and reach a decision about how the transhumant herders who cross into Nigeria seasonally should or should not benefit from the Plan.	Authorities go need consider weather change mata join, make dem decide if herders from oda kontris sometimes go benefit from di plan sef
While some of these steps will take time, the Plans proponents should focus on delivering concrete, visible results on a relatively short-term basis.	As some of dis step go take time,make di pipo wey dey plan am focus on how dem go fit bring result wey strong, wey pipo go fit see for small time
Less than two years from now, the country will hold general elections.	less dan two years from now, di kontri go hold general election
If the Plan is to survive the change of government that will follow, politicians may need to be able to produce clear proof of its benefits (Having served two terms, President Buhari and many state governors are ineligible to compete, meaning that change is certain.)	if di plan go survive di change of goment wey go follow, Politians go need bring proof wey clear say e get benefit (Change dey certain, as president Buhari and many state governor dem no go fit compete again as dey don serve two term)
Ideally, by the time campaigning heats up in late 2022, the Plans backers should be able to point to at least a handful of newly constructed ranches or rehabilitated reserves, strong donor and investor commitments, and the first of a cadre of newly trained livestock management professionals.	By di time wey champaign for election don dey hot for 2022 endin , di pipo wey dey back di plan suppose fit show some of di ranch wey dem build or di reserve wey dem repair,strong donor wey dem get and dia investors commitment and di first group of pipo wey dey don train to be professional for Livestock mamagement
None of this will be easy, but the Plan is worth the effort.	Nothin for dis thin dey easy but di plan worth di effort

Speaker, followed suit and passed the Bill on Wednesday 19th May, 2021.	Di speaker sef follow wetin dem do and he pass di Bill on Wednesday 19th May, 2021.
As you may well be aware, the Bill to establish the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) has been one of the most viciously attacked and antagonised bill in the National Assembly in recent times.	As una fit don hear before, di Bill wey dem wan take establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) dey among di bill wey dem don tok NO to for inside National Assembly.
Sadly the attacks came from those who ought to be partners in progress in the fight against endemic corruption in Nigeria, but have rather designated themselves as enemies of the general good.	Di sad thing be say na pipo wey suppose dey put mouth for di fight against corrupt waka for inside Naija dey attack di bill, dem don turn to enemy for common ood.
Good is good it has no substitute so also is bad.	Gud thing na gud thing, e no get substitute, na so bad thing sef be.
No matter how long it takes, good always prevails over bad just as the superiority of light over darkness remain constant and unquestionable	No mata as e take long reach, good go always prevails ova bad just as di light superior ova darknes take dey constant and unquestionable
It is indeed important for us to have a glimpse of how it all happened at the National Assembly.	e dey important say say make we see small of how e take happen for di National Assembly.
Interestingly, The Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) was first passed into law by the 9th Senate on the 2nd day of March, 2021 having undergone the rigour of legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual at its 3rd Reading on the 2nd March, 2021 the bill was unanimously passed into law by the Nigeria Senate having deeply considered the urgent need for this noble legislation, of course this was not without series of thunder bolts from detractors who would not stop at any length to see that any legislation that would be helpful in assisting the Buhari-led administration to fight corruption does not see the light of the day but the senate stood firm and saw it through.	E dey interestin say, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) na di 9th Senate first pass am into law  on di 2nd day of March, 2021 as e done pass di  legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual for di 3rd Reading on di 2nd March, 2021 senate dem pass di Bill  into law  wit one voice when dem don consider di urgent need  for di noble legislation, of kos no be sauy e apun without plenty  thunder bolts from detractors  wey no go stop at any lenght to see say any legislation wey go help di administration wey Buhari lead to fight corruption no see see light of day but senate stand welwel and dem see am through.
It is very important for the public to know that (CIFIPN) is not just a noble body but a novel one in Nigeria that is targeted at bridging the gap that has long been existing in the forensics space.	E dey very important for make public know say (CIFIPN) no be just any noble bodi but a new one for Naija wey dem target say make e bridge di gap wey don dey for long for di forensics space.
Today, the journey to having a standard body that would regulate the practice of forensics in Nigeria is at its peak and Nigerians must rise to challenge the few anti-government bodies that would want to sabotage this step.	Today, di waka to get one standard bodi wey go dey regulate di practice of forensics for Naija for im peak and make Naija pipo rise make dem challenge di few anti-goment bodi wey fit intend to sabotage dis step.
The passage of this Bill by the National Assembly, no doubt, is a clear demonstration of its patriotic zeal and the need to further strengthen all national efforts geared towards the fight against corruption, which has hindered development in every aspect of our national lives. 	Dis bill wey National Assembly don pass, show say clearly dem demonstrate say dem dey patriotic and di need to strengthen national efforts against corruption, wey don stand dey block development for evri aspect of awa national live.
This legislative bold step, taken by the two Chambers of the National Assembly, is quite historic and symbolic, coming at a time that Nigeria is in dire need of legislation(s)	Dis beta step for inside legislation , wey di two Chambers of di National Assembly take, dey historic and symbolic, e dey happen at a time wey Nigeria dey need legislation welwel.
that will give more bite to its anti-corruption drive in view of the raising spate of criminal and corrupt practices, across the globe.	dat one go give beta way for im anti-corruption drive as di spate of criminal and corrupt waka don rise across di globe.
As we all know, crime generally, has assumed a new dimension, due to advancement in science and technology in the 21st Century. 	As we all sabi, crime don enter anoda level as science and technology don improve for 21st century.
Therefore, the passage of this Bill is apt and timely and it has shown clearly that we have flexible and responsive Legislature that is in tune and in touch with emerging global realities and ever-ready to enact legislations that will meet the yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians. 	Therefore, as dem pass di bill dey gud and e apun for beta time, plus e don show clearly say we get flexible and responive legislature wey sabi di thing wey dey apun for di world, and dem dey redi to do legislation wey go meet wetin Nigeria pipo dey talk.
It is apposite to also state that the journey, which culminated into the passage of this Bill, began in the 8th National Assembly whereby, our Bill was sponsored by Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, Ph.D, CON, the current President of Senate when he was a Senate Leader, because of its strategic importance to the anti-corruption drive of this administration. 	Make we also tok say di journey wey dey for inside as dem take pass di bill make e for turn to law, don start since di 8th National Assembly, wia Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan Ph.D, CON wey be current Senate President sponsor awa bill, when he be senate Leader, bikos e dey important to di anti corruption waka of dis admiistration.
For the benefit of hindsight, when our Bill was introduced in the two Chambers during the 8th National Assembly, all-inclusive public hearings were conducted by the relevant Committees of the respective Chambers. 	For beta understandin, when we be introduce awa bill for inside di two chamber durin di 8th Assembly, dem do public hearin wey carry evribodi along for inside di chamber.
Thereafter and in spite of opposition from stakeholders who were in the minority, led by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), the National Assembly passed the Bill, in view of its significance and the part it will play in the fight against corruption.  	Thereafter, and ontop say minority pipo wey be stakeholder oppose am, na Institute of Chatered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) lead dem, di National Assembly pass di bill, with view of how e take get significance and di part wey go play for di fight against corruption.
Afterward, the Bill was forwarded to Mr President for Presidential Assent, which was not given before the Dissolution of the 8th National Assembly in June, 2019. 	Afterward, dem forward di bill give oga Presido, make e for put hand, but e neva put hand before dem scatter di 8th Assembly for inside June 2019.
It is on the strength of this, that the Bill was re-introduced in this 9th National Assembly and this time around, it was sponsored by Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, the current Leader of the Senate, in view of the importance attached to it.	Na on dis stregth dem take bring di bill abck for di 9th National Assembly, na Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, di current Leader for di Senate, in view of as e take dey important.
We are constrained to make this clarification in order to clear the air on the cheap propaganda being propelled by our detractors that our Bill was rejected by the 8th National Assembly. 	We dey pushed to make dis clarification in order to clear di air on di cheap cheap propaganda wey pipo wey dey distract us dey tok say di 8th Assembly don reject awa bill.
Also worthy of mention is the fact that our Bill has being mistaken for similar Bills, which were recently introduced in both the Senate and the House of Representatives Chambers. 	 Also we suppose mention di fact say dem don mistake awa bill with abother bill dem wey dey similar wey dem just introduce for both di senate and House of Represntative Chambers.
These Bills, upon our close scrutiny, we discovered that they are merely duplications of the intents and purports of our Bill. 	Dis bill dem, as we don scrutize dem with close eye, we discover say dem just copy awa intention and di thing wey awa bill stand for.
It must be stressed that none of these Bills were introduced in the 8th National Assembly, other than our Bill. 	We suppose draw hear tok am say dem no introduce any of di bills dem for inside 8th Assembly, na only awa bill.
As such, we are the first to ever come up with a Bill of this magnitude,(Forensic) 	As such, na we be di first to carry bill wey big reach like dis (Forensic)
having seen the urgent need to establish such great Institute.  	As we don see say e dey very urgent to establish dat kind great Institute.
The decision to establish the Institute was taken after a painstaking study of how the Institutes operate in other jurisdictions and how well they have helped in crime detection, investigation and prosecution.   	Dem take di decision wey dem take establish di Institute afta dem study how di Institute dey take operate for other jurisdiction and how dem don take help crime detection, investigation and prosecution.
It is instructive to note that our Institute has been in existence since 2009. 	Na part of instruction make dem for know say awa Institute don dey since 2009.
And over the years, we have trained professionals in the field of forensic science and technology, targeted at inculcating the requisite skills and acumen in the pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:	And over di years, And over di years, we don train professionala to sabi forensic science technology, targeted at inculcatin di requisite skil dem for di pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:

You will agree with me that in today's world, the conventional ways of investigating crimes, with a view to fighting it has become obsolete. 	You go follow me reason say for inside di obodo world wey we dey today, di normal way wey we dey take investigate crime, on to say we want stop am don bikom old something.
As such, for us as a nation to do something meaningful in this regard, it is paramount that we align ourselves with the global trend and emerging innovations, targeted at fighting corruption.	As such, make we as a kontri for do something wey get meanin for dis matter, e dey paramount say make we follow global trend and new innovations, wey dem put for ground to take fight corruption.
It is in line with this reasoning that the idea of establishing this Institute was conceived with a well-structure laudable objectives that are relevant to the anti-corruption drive of this administration. 	Na dis kind way we take reason to establish dis Institute wey get betta objective dat is relevant to di anti-corruption agenda of dis administration.
Time will not permit me to highlight all the objectives of the Bill here. 	Time no too dey for me to tok about evrithing wey dey inside di bill for here.
However, I wish to crave your indulgence to highlight a few of the objectives of the Bill, for the purpose of this address, as follows: 	However, I wan make you allow me to mention few of wetin di Bill go do, for di purpose of dis tok, as e take be like dis:
To establish a Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals in Nigeria in order to develop and train Professionals in this specialized field, through systemic and professional examination and certification that will enhance the acquisition of the requisite skills in the use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and prevention; 	say make we for establish Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals in Nigeria, to develop and train professional for inside dis specialised field, with systemic and professional examination and certification wey go give better skil inside use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and detection;
To provide a platform for training and re-training of intending professionals in the usage of Forensic Science and technological tools and techniques in the investigation of frauds in both public and private sectors of our economy, in line with international best practices; 	To provide platform wey dem go dey take train and retrain of pipo wey wan bikom professional on top how dem dey take use Forensic Science and Technology tools and techniques dey investigate fraud for both public and private sector of di economy, as dem dey take do evriwia;

To fill the existing huge vacuum in our archaic and conventional system of investigation with the introduction of a unique operation of forensic science to help the country from expending its scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates to do forensic investigations in Nigeria; 	To take fill di huge vacuum wey dey exist for awa  normal system of investigation weu don old with di introduction of a unique operation of forensic science to help di country from expending im scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates to do forensic investigations for inside Naija;
To develop a broad-based mechanism and training programmes that cut across all the strata of our investigation architecture, involving professionals such as Lawyers, Criminologists, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economists. 	To develop broad-based mechanism and training programmes wey go cut across all di strata of awa investigation architecture, involving professionals such as Lawyers, Criminologists, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economists.
This would enhance effective and efficient disposition of cases in line with global best practices; and 	Dis one go enhance effective plus efficient disposition of cases as dem dey take do am globally; and
To enhance Nigerias anti-fraud mechanisms, through the provision of a legal framework for the professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals in Nigeria, among others.	To take enhance anti-fraud mechanism for Naija, through di provision of a legal framework for di professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals for Naija, among odas.
From the foregoing, it is apparent that the role of this Institute is quite strategic and important.	From di foregoing, e don show say di role of dis Institute dey strategic and important.
It is also pertinent to reiterate that forensic science is a very wide and all-encompassing field, which requires effective and efficient regulation for the attainment and sustainability of high level professionalism and ethical standards. 	E also dey important make we tok say forensic science dey very wide and na field wey involve many oda, and e require effective and efficient regulation make we for attain and sustain high level professionalism and ethical standard.
The broad spectrum of the scope and focal point of the Institute, includes but not limited to forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic law; forensic accounting; forensic nursing; forensic pathology; forensic engineering; forensic psychology; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic linguistics; forensic deontology; forensic dentistry; forensic archeology; forensic graphology, forensic entomology, etc.	Di broad spectrum of di scope and focal point of di Institute, includes but no be only forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic law; forensic accounting; forensic nursing; forensic pathology; forensic engineering; forensic psychology; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic linguistics; forensic deontology; forensic dentistry; forensic archeology; forensic graphology, forensic entomology, etc.
Accordingly, you will agree with me that our Institute is bringing on board, a unique concept of crime detection and investigation in conformity with international best practices.	Accordingly, you go agree say awa Institute don bring unique concept enter crime detection and investigation wey follow international best practices.
This concept is far beyond the reasoning of those whose myopic view about the purports of our Bill have beclouded their senses of reasoning, due to narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, which is outside their jurisdiction and scope of operations.	Di concept pass as myopic pipo dey take thingk about awa bill don cover dem sense of thingkin, due to narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, wey don pass dem jurisdiction and scope of operation.
On a lighter note, I wish to draw the attention of everyone to the funny scenario that is playing out now, and as a matter of fact, it should be a source of concern for all well-meaning Nigerians. 	 On a lighter note, I wan draw di attention of evrione to di funny scenario dat is playin out now, and as a matter of fact, e suppose be a source of concern for all beta Naija pipo.
When the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill was introduced in the 8th National Assembly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), came out vehemently to oppose its passage because according to them, it is an unnecessary duplication of functions already undertaken by their Institute.	Wen dem introduce di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill for di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), kom out wit anger to oppose di passage bikos according to dem, na unnecessary duplication of function wey dem Institute don dey do.
However, upon the re-introduction of our Bill in this 9th National Assembly, and having seen the overwhelming and accelerated legislative supports, our Bill has received from the two Chambers, ICAN has now realized that forensic science is a unique field of practice, and as we speak, they have introduced a similar Bill that is currently before the House of Representatives, having failed woefully in their attempts to stop the passage of our Bill.	However, as dem don take introduce awa bill again for dis 9th National Assembly, and as we don see di overwhelmin and accelerated legislative support wey di two Chambers don give awa bill, ICAn don realize say forensic science na uniques field of practice, and as we dey talk, dem don bring similar Bill kom meet di House of Representative, as dem don fail wofully for dem attempt to stop di passage of dis awa bill.
One may ask, what has changed between now and the past, where ICAN holds the view that there shouldn't be any Institute other than theirs to regulate the practice of forensic science?	One fit ask, wetin don change between now and di past, wia ICAN get di view say make any oda Institute no dey regulate di practices of forensic science?
your answer is as good as mine.	Your answer na di same thing with my own.
I wish to also inform you that the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), is not left out of this funny theatrical episode.	I for also like inform you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), also dey part of dis di episode.
Just like their ICAN counterpart, they have also introduced a Bill in the House of Representatives with the nomenclature the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, which was initiated and being promoted by ANAN.	 which was initiated and being promoted by ANAN. Just as dem ICAN counterpart, dey sef don introduce one bill for inside House of Representative wey di same structure with di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, wey be na ANAN initiate am, and na dem promote am.
I decided to bring out all these facts so that Nigerians and even the international communities will understand the extent to which some people can go in order to achieve their aims.	I decide say make I tok all di fact dem make Nigeria pipo and even international community for understand di extent to which some pipo fit go say make dem for achieve dem aim.
However, we are not perturbed by these developments because we believe in the credibility and ability of the National Assembly and indeed the Presidency to do what is right and not to allow themselves to be manipulated in any way, by these unnecessary distractions, so as not to make a mockery of the entire thing.	However, dis development no disturb us at all, bikos we believe ontop credibility and ability of di National Assembly and also for di Presidency to do di correct thing, make dem no enter manipulate in any way, with dis unnecessarydistractions dem, make dem for no make mockery of do whole thing.
The known practical and antagonist of this Bill has remained ICAN for reason that is now becoming obvious.	Na ICAN be di practical and antagonist for dis bill and we don dey see di reason now.
They engaged several bystanders into writing frivolous petitions some even targeted at the leadership of the Senate with a tone of blackmail.	Dem engage several bystanders into make dem write bad petition, dem even target di leadership for inside Senate, and e sound like say na bleckmail.
Having failed woefully at the senate, the antagonists shifted their attention to the House of Representatives with the same bystanders writing all manner of publication.	As dem don fail for inside Senate, di antagonist shift attention go House of Representative with di same bystanders as dem just dey write many many publication.
Yet again, they failed.	and again, dem fail.
Ordinarily by legislative procedure, a bill that has been passed by the Senate would only require concurrence by the House safe for where there are observations.	Ordinarily according to legislative procedure, bill wey Senate don passgo only need concurrence by di House except wen dem get observation.
But in the case of the CIFIPN Bill, the antagonist fought the passage of the bill until truth prevail and on the 19th May, 2021 the Bill for the establishment of the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of what Standard Knowledge and Skills to be Attained by Persons seeking to become Registered Members and Qualify to Practice as Forensic and Investigative Professionals; and for Related Matters (HB. 791) was passed into law by the House of Representative.

ICAN has now registered its Bill in the House of Representatives titled (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.	ICAN don register dem own Bill for inside di House of Respresentatives wey dem title  (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.
This ICAN new Bill has in it full of provision for practice of forensic, and also that they will establish a Forensic University in Nigeria and without which nobody can practice forensic in Nigeria, and violation of this section will lead such a person to some years imprisonment.	Di new Bill wey ICAn bring get contain full provision to dey take practice forensic, plus say dem wan establish forensic university for inside Nigeria, and without am, nobodi go fit practice forensics for Nigeria, and pesin wey violate am go enter prison for some years.
This sounds so strange in a country full of enlightened people.	Dis wan dey strange for ear for inside kontri wey plenty oepn eye pipo dey.
My joy is that Nigeria is not a Banana Republic	D tin wey make me api be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic
no matter the level of corruption therein.	No mata di level of coruption wey dey dere.
We are already challenging the passage of the bills by the House of Representatives.	We don dey challenge as House of Representatives take pass bill.
It should be noted that, our challenging the bill is not borne out of malice or ill will, but because we are certain that the purpose of this bill is to halt presidential assent under the guise of existence of similar legislation.	We suppose note am say, as we dey challenge di bill no be for bad belle, but bikos say we dey certain say di purpose of di bill na to stop presidential assent under di disguise say similar legislation don dey before.
We will not allow ourselves and Nigerians to be deceived by their antics.	We no go gree make dem deceive us and Naija people with dem wayo.
You would recall how ICAN vehemently opposed this enactment of CIFIPN and in one of its sponsored publications by the Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria led by Engr.(Chief)	You go remember how ICAn take open eye oppose di CIFIPN and for inside one pubication wey dem sponsor by di Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria led by Engr.(Chief)
Olumuyiwa Alade on the 24th May, 2019 made frantic efforts to say that ICAN under its enabling laws is empowered to practice Forensics and therefore for CIFIPN Bill to be passed it would amount to duplication of laws, today ICAN is presenting its ACT to be repealed and re-enacted with the inclusion of Forensics in the new law.	Olumuyiwa Alade on 24th May, 2019 make plenty effort to tell us say di law wey dey enable ICAN don give am power to do forensics and to pass di CIFIPN Bill go be like dem just dey duplicate law, but today ICAN don dey present dem law say make dem for include forensics inside di new law.
The question is, what has changed?	Di question is, wetin don change?
The same law that ICAN has always told the public that it has forensics is now seeking for its re-enactment.	Di same law wey ICAN wey ICAN don tell di public say e get forensics kom dey seek say make dem re-enact am.
As always, while we are not opposed to any group proposing the inclusion of forensics in its laws, we are however concerned that a body should not try to perpetuate itself.	As always, as we no dey oppose any group wey dey propose say make dem include forensics fot dem law, awa concern be say make one bodi no try perpetuate imsef.
ICAN and its cohorts have realised their inability to stop the passage of CIFIPN	ICAN and dem cohorts don realise dem inability to stop di passage of CIFIPN
so they want to have a body within itself.	So dem wan get one union for demsef.
What they are scared of is checks and balances, they would not want another professional body to investigate their activities because they know what they are doing to the economy of this nation.	Na checks and balances dey fear dem, dem no go want want make anoda professional bodi to investigate dia activities bikos dem know wetin dem dey do to di economy of dis nation.
How can they want to be a judge in their own case?	How dem go wan dey judge dem own case by demsef?
This sounds so strange.	Dis one sound strange welwel.
On this note, we are calling on the National Assembly to beware of the antics of these groups, they cannot be speaking from both sides of their mouth and expect the National Assembly to be cajoled.	On dis note, we dey  call on di National Assembly to beware of di wayo wey dis group get, dey no suppose dey talk from both sides of dem mouth,make dem kom dey  expect to use am cajole National Assembly.
We want to yet again appreciate the doggedness of the 9th Assembly in ensuring that the Bill is passed, the Nigerian people are more than ever before convinced of the readiness of this administration to combat corruption through every possible means and would at all times encourage legislation that is aimed at achieving this goal.	Once again, we wan appreciate di commit wey di 9th Assembly put to make sure say dem pass di Bill, Naija pipo don know say dis administration dey ready to fight corruption by evri means and dem go encourage legislation wey dem aim say fit help dem achieve dis goal
We are confident that His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari will not hesitate in assenting to this Bill as soon as it gets to his desk.	We get confident say His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari no got hesitate to put hand for di Bill as soon as e enter im table
We are calling on all Nigerians to come and be part of the Forensics Profession.	We dey call Naija peipo make dem kom take part for Forensic Profession.
The profession is open for all professionals in various field of endeavours.	Di profession dey open to all professional pipo for different area dem.
There is a training arm of the institute that will studiously guide you and equip you.	Di Institute get trainig section wey go guide and equip una.

The maize variety is bred with protection against insect pests and draught.	Dis kind maize na im get protection against pest and draught for im breed.
The Principal Investigator, Professor Rabiu Adamu and other scientists who conducted journalists round the harvest, said the idea of the research work was to produce maize varieties that are resistance or that are highly protected against two major insect pests: stalk (stem) borers and Fall Army Worm and additional protection against moderate draught.	Professor Rabiu Adamu wey be Principal Investigator, plus oda scientist wey carry journalists round d harvest, tok say di idea of di project na to produce maize variety wey dey resistance or wey dey protected against two major insect pest: stalk (stem) borers and Fall Army Worm plus another protection against moderate draught.
This is all about producing crops that are high yielding under stressed conditions; the stresses are Fall Army Warm and stem borers, which are major constraints to maize production.	Dis is all about producing crops that are high yielding under stressed conditions; di stresses are Fall Army Warm and stem borers, which are major constraints to maize production.

So, in essence, this is what we are trying to showcase,the Principal researcher said.	Di Principal researcher tok say na wetin dem dey try showcase be dat.
With the three CFT trials successful, researchers will have to test and validate them from the farmers field to show that what they recorded from their own research station equally performs well in the farmers fields on wide range of locations over wide ecological conditions, beginning from 2021 rainy season.	As di three CFT trial don dey successful, pipo wey dey do research go need to test and validate dem to show say wetin dem record for inside dem research station dey perform well for inside di farmers field for different locations and ecological conditions as e go start for di rainy season of 2021.

The varieties under trials were infested three times unlike the previous ones to virtually look at the efficacy of the BT gene in the maize product.	We don infest di varieties wey we dey put for trial three times unlike di previous one make we for take look how di BT gene take dey effective reach for di maize product.
With the outcome, researchers said the yield will definitely increase above 17 per cent.	With di outcome, researcher dem don tok say di yield go increase reach 17 percent.
So after, we're going to analyze the data and then prepare a document to get approval for environmental release.	So afta, we go analyze di data, and go prepare document to take get approval for environmental release.

Dr Rose Maxwell Gidado, the Country Coordinator OFAB Nigeria, said the impact was actually going to be much.	Dr Rose Maxwell Gidado, wey be di Country Coordinator OFAB Nigeria, tok di impact go plenty welwel.
Farmers are going to have yield increase of 17 percent and you know that farming is all about productivity and harvestable yield.	Farmer dem yield go increase by 17 percent and you know say na productivity and harvest be di koko for farming.
Once you have yield, of cause you're going to have bumper harvest and profit.	Once you don gree, you go get plenty harvest and profit.

Between DSS and regional separatists	Between DSS and pipo wey wan separate for some region
Repeated warnings by the DSS to persons and groups whose utterances and activities persistently constitute provocative disruptions of the ethno-religious environment and threaten harmonious co-existence of the majority common folks of this country, were beginning to sound monotonous and unconvincing until guilty conscience forced the prime suspects out of their deceptive demeanour.	As DSS don put hand for ear for group and pipo dem wey dey tok and do things wey fit provoke and distrupt di ethno-religious environment and threaten harmonous co-existence of di majority common folk of di kontri, don begin dey sound like say na one pesin tok until dem force dem komot for wia dem dey deceive pipo.
Lingering questions about who or which persons and groups the security agency was referring to were promptly vapourized in the heated rhetorical outbursts of the nation's prominent geo-ethnic agitators 	Question wey don dey linger about who or which pesin and group di security agent dey follow tok na im dem  promptly vapourized for di heated rhetorical outbust of di nation prominent geo-ethnic agitator dem.
Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).	Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
It then dawned on all that indeed these were the persons and groups  that have continued to resort to inciting, unguarded and divisive statements, and acts to pit citizens against one another in order to apparently inflame the embers of tribal and religious discord, as the DSS charged in one of its warnings.	E kom clear for all of us eye say dis na di group of pipo wey don kontinu to dey resort to inciting, unguarded and divisive statement and act dem, to take set kontri pipo against demsef to take put fire of tribal and religious discord, as di DSS din charge for one of dem warning.
Interestingly, none of these prime suspects in the exploitation of some fault lines to cause ethno-religious violence in some parts of the country could categorically distance itself from the treacherous and subversive activities detected by the security agency.	Interestingly, non for inside di major suspect dem for di exploitation of some fault line dem to take kos ethno-religious violence for some part of di kontri fit categorically distance demsef from di treacherous and subversive activity dem wey security agent detect.
They chorused a common conviction that the DSS knows those responsible, differing only in the respective directions of their accusing fingers.	Dem chorus di same conviction say di DSS sabi di pipo wey dey responsible, dem only differ for di direction wey dem dey point dem accusing finger.
While Afenifere retorted these people know those who are responsible for these acts but can't touch them because of their connections, PANDEV rehashed its grouse about many people feeling alienated and ACF feigned ignorance, asking who are the people?	AS Afenifere tok say dis pipo sabi di ones wey dey responsible for di acts, but dem no fit touch dem bikos of di connect wey dem get, PANDEV tok am again about plenty pipo wey dey run alienated and ACF dey do like say dem no know, dem dey ask who di pipo be?
Since the DSS knows them and their satanic mission, they should be proactive in dealing with them.	Since di DSS know dem and dem satanic waka, make dem take action to take deal with dem.
The NEF sounded unconvinced with if there are people pushing the country into deeper crises and they are known; they should be treated according to the law.	Di NEF sound like pesin wey no dey convinced with if say pipo dey wey dey push di kontri enter deep crises  and dem know dem, make dem treat dem accordin to di law.
You don't have to be a spook to know what the DSS knows about each and all of these flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics in Nigeria or to understand why they all know that DSS knows them yet they insist on passing the buck outside their cliques.	You no need to be spook to know wetin di DSS sabi about dis flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics for Nigeria or to understand why dem all know say DSS sabi dem yet dem insist to pass di buck outside dem clique.
The truth is that these champions of ethnic politics know of no better solution to Nigeria's myriad problems than for their sectional enclaves and chiefs to lord it over the rest of the country as rulers, not leaders!	 Di truth be say dis pipo wey dey champion ethnic politics no sabi any better solution to di problem wey Nigeria dey face than make dem sectional enclave and chief dey lord am ova di remainin of di kontri as rulers, not leaders!
So desperate and unscrupulous are they in pursuing their inordinate ambitions that they absurdly and frequently agitate for break-up of Nigeria.	Dem dey desperate and unscrupulous to pursue dem inordinate ambition dem dat dem dey agitate absurdly and frequently to take break Nigeria up.
Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate their geographical consciousness to reduce all it takes to excising the territorial contours of their enclaves with the frenzied ease of cutting their portion of the remaining crumbs of the proverbial national cake.	Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate dia geographical consciousness to reduce all it takes to excising di territorial contours of dia enclaves with di frenzied ease of cutting dia portion of di remaining crumbs of di proverbial national cake.
Simply put, breaking up or out of Nigeria as an ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to achieve inordinate ambitions of persons or groups restlessly undermining aspirations of majority wa-zo-bia Nigerian commoners for enduring peaceful coexistence, is easier said than done.	To put am simple, to break up or out of Nigeria as one ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to achieve inordinate ambition of pipo or group wey dey undermine di ambition of majority wa-zo-bia Nigeria commoner restlessly for enduring peaceful coexistence, e easy to tok pass to do.
These regional groups actually constitute major hindrances to the steady attainment of unity and peaceful coexistence that Nigeria has been labouring for since flag independence.	All dis group be major block to di steady attainment of unity and to dey live together in peace wey Nigeria don dey labour for since flag of independence.
For as long as they continue to parade the political terrain as ethnic champions, for so long will they regard Nigeria as an entitlement for their ethnic stake in the population, to be claimed or seized and, if all else fails, deconstructed and disowned as a failed state.	For as long as dem kontinu to parade di political terrain as ethnic champions, na for so long wey dem go regard Nigeria as an entitlement for dem ethnic stake for di population, to be claimed or seized, and if all fail, make dem deconstruct am and disown am as state wey don fail.
Whenever they meet, the agenda is not for Nigeria's progress and development, unless its leadership is firmly in their grasp, otherwise it is all about heckling and jostling around with barely concealed determination to deploy the notorious Nigerian Ph.d, pull-him-down syndrome against the incumbent non-indigene President.	Whenever dem meet, di agenda no be for say make Nigeria for progress and develop, unless di leadership dey dem hand firmly, odawise na all about hecking and jostling around wit barely concealed determination to deploy di notorious Nigerian Ph.d, pull-him-down syndrome against di incumbent non-indigene President.
Whether it is ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, their existence and activities will always be antithetical to Nigeria's quest for unity, peace and development.	Whether na ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, dem existence and activities go dey oppose di quest of Nigeria for unity, peace and development.

The trouble in Ilorin was over the refusal of some Christian faith schools to allow their Muslim students wear hijab to the schools.	DI trouble wey dey for Ilorin na as dem take refuse of some Christian faith school dem to allow dem muslim student to dey wear hijab kom school.
The solution to this impasse was the debate on the Religious Discrimination (Prohibition, Prevention)	Di solution for this predicament na di debate on top Religious Discrimination (Prohibition, Prevention)
RDPP Bill, 2021, derisively tagged Hijab Bill by a section of the Nigerian media.	RDPP Bill, 2021, as dem ridicule Hijab Bill for a section of media for Nigeria.
Both events sparked heated and often emotional debates that, at the bottom of it all, threaten to negate Nigeria's multicultural identity and reality.	Both event be spark heated argument and often emotional debate wey, at di bottom of evritin, dey threaten to negate multicultural identity and reality of Nigeria.
The whole idea in Kwara of the proprietors of the schools banning hijab-adorning Muslim students and their sympathisers can be reduced to what not to wear in public.

The former is clearly in breach of the fundamental human rights of the Muslim students to express their faith without discrimination; even though the school may have their defence for taking such a position.	E dey clear say di former clearly breach di fundamental human right of di muslim students to take express dem faith without discrimination; even though di school fit get defence or taking dat kind position.
The latter is trying to assert this right not only for Muslims but also Christians wherever or whenever they are threatened with discrimination based on their professed faith.	Di latter dey try to assert dis right no be for Muslim dem alone but also for Christians wiaver or whenever dem threaten dem wit discrimination bikos of di fauth wey dem show.
Running through the argument of the proprietors of the Christian faith schools in Kwara, one could easily understand the pragmatic appeal of the argument that Muslim children should go to other schools elsewhere if they don't want to conform.	To run through di argument wey proprietor of Christian faith schools inside Kwara, easy for pesin to understand di pragmatic appeal of di argument say make Muslim children go oda school dem fpr oda pleces if dem no wan conform.
The problems with this argument are many.	Di problem wey die argument get many.

First, to tok say make Muslim student dem go anoda place unless dem agree to rule of di school on top uniform dey do very little to promote inclusiveness, wey be di bedrock of awa multicultural and multi-religious society.
Secondly, the position begs the moral question: is it justifiable to base a school rule because of Christian majoritarian nature of the school?	Secondaly, di position dey ask moral question: shey we fit justify to base rule for school on top di Christian majoritarian of di school?
Then, thirdly, the go elsewhere argument appears to ignore the difficulties in changing a school for a child.	Then, di third one, di argument o go elsewia appear say e don ignore di difficulty dem wey dey inside changing school for a pikin.
The inconvenience is huge.	Di inconvenience plenty.
The act of changing schools for a child, educational psychologists will tell you, interferes negatively with not only its emotional but academic development too.	As dem dey change school for pikin dem, pipo wey dey education psychology go tell you say, e dey interfere negatively with not just emotional but academic development too.
Finally, the Christian faith schools by themselves risk what is called ghettorization by concentrating students with the same religious beliefs in particular schools.

In a country that guarantees freedom of religion, signed the declaration of International Human Rights, the basic question to ask is: how justifiable is it to deny a Nigerian child access to a school of its choice on the basis of the manifestation of its religion?	For inside kontri wey guarantee freedom of religion, wey sign di declaration of international Human Rights, di basic question to ask na: how justifiable e be to deny child for inside Nigeria access to school of dem choice on top di basis of dem religion?

After all, it is only to expand and expatiate the provisions of Nigeria's constitution and the UDHR document as explained above.	After all, na only to expand and expatiate di provision dem wey dey for inside di Nigeria constitution and for UDHR document as we take tok am above.
It is in line with similar laws passed recently in the country seeking to tackle social menace and harmful cultural practice the Disability Law and the Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP).	E follow line with similar law dem wey dem pass for di kontri to take tackle social wahal and cultural practice dem wey dey harmful di law wey dey Prohibit violence against pipo and disability law (VAPP).
While disability seeks to eradicate all forms of discrimination based on a persons disabilities, VAPP is addressing domestic and other gender-based violence in the country.	As disability dey try to komot any discrimination wey dey face pipo wey get disability, VAPP dey face domestic plus oda gender violence dem for inside di kontri.
One at a time, our representatives in the legislative chambers are tackling the social menaces bedeviling our country through legal instruments.	One by one, pipo wey dey represent us for inside di legislative chamber dem don dey use legal instrument dey  tackle all social wahala  wey dey face awa kontri.

Dem dey address all dis social roughness no be to say law be no dey before wey dey address dem, but dem wan carry evritin togeda make dem for no allow see finish.
While UDHR may seem like a far, distant document with no instrument of enforcement, the RDPP Law and others like it are provided to allocate punishments for offenders.	As e be like say road still far for UDHR, and instrument to take enforce am neva dey, di RDPP law and oda law dem wey resemble am dey ground to carry punishment give offenders.
Contrary to the view of its critics, as far as the RDPP Bill is concerned, there is nothing to show attempts at seeking the enthronement of a state religion on any state that may domesticate the law eventually.	As e dey contradict di view of critics, as far as di RDPP Bill dey concerned, no prove dey say dem wan dem wan put state of religion on top any state wey fit domesticate di law.
It does not go against Section 10 of the Nigerian Constitution that says The Government of the Federation or of a State shall not adopt any religion as State Religion.	E no go against Section 10 of di Constitution for Nigeria wey support make Di Goment of do Federation or for State fit no adopt any religion as State Religion.
To peddle this argument, because the bill calls on the general public to respect the rights of Muslim women that wear Hijab in public spaces smacks of Islamophobia only.	To push di argument, bikos di bill dey call for general public to dey respect di right of womn dem wey be muslim wey dey wear Hijab for public place, say na to only quench Islamaphobia.
In the final analysis, to deny a Nigerian  male or female  his or her religious freedom negates our multicultural pretenses.	For di final analysis, e dey go against awa multicultural pretenses to dey deny any Nigerian be it male or female dem religios freedom.
It negates the concept of equality, and basic human right as enshrined in Nigeria's constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights legal document.	E dey against equality, and basic human right as e take dey inside constitution for Nigeria and di legal document for Universal Declaration of Human Rghts.
A bill that will criminalize such decimations based on religious grounds, like the RDPP bill, is a welcome development.	Bill wey go make dat kind decimation on religion bikom criminal, like di RDPP bill go get welkom nod.

E-commerce refers to the use of communications technology particularly the internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers.	E-commerce dey refer to di use of communication technology especially di internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers.
The internet has brought about a fundamental shift in national economies that are isolated from each other by barriers to cross-border trade and investment, isolated by distance, time zone and languages and isolated by the national differences in government regulations.	Di internet don bring fundamental shift enter economy dem wey no near each oda bikos of brier enter ross-border trade and investment, wey distance far, time zone and language and wey national goment regulation different.
E-commerce equally fosters direct access to distant markets and promotes globalisation and commercial activities and blur many of the current distinctions between domestic and foreign companies to an extent that it becomes practically impossible to determine the origin of the products.	E-commerce dey foster direct access to market wey no near and e dey promote globalisation and commercial activities plus e dey komot distinction between domestic and foreign companies to di extent wey e no go possible to know wia di product from kom.
E-commerce is not limited to the purchase of a product, it includes e-mail, and other communications platforms, all information or services that a company may offer to customers over the net, from pre-purchase information to aftersale service and support.	E-commerce no dey limited to buying of product alone, e include e-mail, plus oda communication platform dem, all di informate or service wey company fit offer customer on top net, from pre-purchase information to aftasale service and support.
The major significance of E-commerce thus lies in the fact that it encourages a single world trading system, which is facilitated by access through electronic means to goods and services from different parts of the world.	Di major significance wey e commerce get dey for di fact say e dey encourage system of tradin wey be single world, wey access through electronic means to take get good and services dem dey facilitate from different parts of di world.
Most of the existing statues in Nigeria lag behind towards the development and growth of e-commerce in particular and ICT as a whole.	Most of di statue wey dey for ground for inside nigeria dey lag behind toward di development and growth of e-commerce in particular and di whole ICT.
So many legal researches and studies on e-commerce in Nigeria have been conducted.	For Nigeria, plenty legal research and study don dey conducted.

E dey important to know say, even wia dem pass dis bill into law, Nigeria fit still face new legal issue for dis area wey go call for legislative intervention.
Given the speed with which the internet is permeating commercial transactions in Nigeria, especially in the banking and telecommunications sectors of the economy, the best that can be suggested is that the legal issues and problems presently confronting e-commerce in the country should be addressed directly and expeditiously, in the interests of the teeming population of Nigerian consumers.

To achieve this, the National Assembly should be pressuriSed into passing bills concerning electronic commerce, a top priority so that they can be enacted into law as quickly as possible.	To achieve dis, make dem pressure di National Assembly to take pass bill concerning electronic commerce as top priority so dat dem go enact dem into law as quick as possible.

And dis don be di pattern wey America soldiers dem dey take behave evriwia for di hundred of America military base oversea from Okinawa for inside Japan, Stuttgart inside Germany, Incirlik and Diyarbakir for Turkey and Pampanga inside  Philippines.
That is why I am perturbed, like many Nigerians, that in a virtual meeting last week with the Secretary of State of the United States of America, Antony Blinken, President Buhari was reported to have asked that the United States considers relocating the African Command (Africom) of its military presently based in the southern German city of Stuttgart to Africa.	Na why i dey upset, like plenty Nigeria pipo, say na for virtual meetin last week wit di di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, na dem report say president Buhari ask United States to consider as dem go take relocate di African Command (Africom) of im military wey dey for Stuttgart for inside southern German city of presently kom Africa.
It is presumed that with this call, President Buhari is making a pitch for Nigeria to host Africom.	We dey thingk am say wit dis kin call, president Buhari dey make way for Nigeria to host Africom.
In the first place, it was a breach of protocol for President Buhari to hold that meeting with the American Secretary of State.	For di first place, na breach of protocol for  President Buhari to do dat meeting wit di American Secretary of State.
The meeting should have been with Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, who would then transmit the details afterwards to the president.	Dem suppose do di meetin wit Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, who o kom carri di detail go meet president later.
Yes, America is a superpower and all that, but protocol is protocol and should be followed strictly in all circumstances.	Yes, America na superpower and all, but protocol na protocol and dem soppose follow am strictly  for evri circumstance.
Understandably, Nigeria is currently faced with gargantuan internal insecurity issues which seem to defy the best efforts of government and the nation's security establishment in tackling it.	We understand say Nigeria dey face big internal security wahala wey be like say e pass di best effort wey goment and security establishment for inside di nation dey make to take tackle am.
Unrelenting terrorist insurgency in the North East, banditry, kidnapping in the North West, farmers/herders clashes all over the country and the targeted killing of security and law enforcement personnel and other Nigerians coupled with the destruction of institutional buildings in the South East, constitute the cocktail of insecurity now ravaging the country.	Terrorist insurgency wey no dey tire for di North East banditry, kidnapping inside di North West, farmers/herders clash dem all over di kontri and as dem dey target and kill security and law enforcement personnel dem and oda Nigeria pipo plus di destruction of institutional building for di South East, na dem join take be di cokctail of insecurity wey don dey ravage di kontri.
But even at that, the call for the hosting of the Africom on Nigerian soil when considered against the various issues and implications of this move to Nigeria is hardly justified.	But even at that, di call to take host Africom on top Nigeria siol when we consider m against various issues and implications of dis move to Nigeria difficult to justify.
Africom is one of nine such commands by the American military establishment to exclusively serve American strategic interests around the world.	Africom na one amng nine of dat kind command wey di America military establish say make e dey serve America strategic interest around di world.
By their doctrine and operational modus, these commands, particularly those outside America like Africom, are not set up primarily to concern themselves with the security and law enforcement issues of their area of coverage.	By dem rule and way of operation, dis commands, particularly di ones wey dey outside America like Africom, dem no set dem up primarily to concern demselves wit security and law enforcement issuefor dem area of coverage.
They only do so when such issues directly affect American interests in the area and in such situations, they are not mandated to yield their modus operandi and share intelligence with the local security and law enforcement agencies.	Dem only do so when such issue dey affect di interest of America directly for di area and for such situation, dem no dey mandated to yield dem modus operandi and share intelligence wit di local security and law enforcement agancy dem
If Africom is set up in Nigeria for instance, it will be an island of its own restricting access to Nigerians of all categories and establishing a jurisdiction within the territorial area of the base that will be virtually off limits to Nigerian security and law enforcement agencies.	If dem set Africom up for Nigeria for instance, e go be island on im ownas e go restrict access to Nigerians of all category and establishing a jurisdiction withing di teritorial area of di base wey go dey virtually off limit to Nigerian security and law enforcement agancy dem.
As it always happens with American military bases outside America, Africom will be a forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and source of acts of sabotage and destabilisation against the host country.	As e dey always apun wit America military base wey dey outside America, Africom go be forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and e go source for act of sabotage and destabilisation against host kontri.
In the particular case of Africom, part of its original concept was actually to contain the growing strategic influence of Nigeria in West Africa and Africa following our successful peace enforcement efforts in Liberia and Sierra Leone and our sterling records of peace keeping around the world.	For dis particular case of Africom, part of im original concept na to kontrol as di strategic influence of Nigeria dey grow for West Africa and Africa as we get successful peace enforecement efforts for Liberia and Sierra Leone and awa beta record of peace keepin around di world.
Africom's precursor was the Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) set up by the Clinton administration to counter Nigeria's strategic interests in Africa.	Di one wey dey before Africom na di Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) wey di Clinton administration set up to take counter di strategic interest of Nigeria for inside Africa.
President Clinton's Secretary of State, the dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, made many secret and open visits to a number of African countries to sell the idea.	Di Secretary of State for president Clinton, di dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, be visit a nomba of African countries secretly to sell di idea.
But because Nigeria was the target, he pointedly left it out from his itinerary.	But bikos Nigeria na di target, he pointedly komot am from im itinerary.
Senegal, which is not far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, was to be the coordinating base of the ACRI and though it was touted as an initiative to facilitate American assistance to African humanitarian issues, its secret protocols were unmistakably military and strategically targeted at Nigeria.	Senegal, wey no far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, na im suppose be di coordinating base of di ACRI and though dem see am initiative to facilitate assistance of America to African humanitarian issues, im secret protocol dem mistake for military and dem target Nigeria strategically.
Due mainly to undisguised hostility to the idea from France, which was averse to seeing the Americans trying to butt into an area it considers its exclusive sphere of influence, the ACRI concept was reviewed.	Due mainly to undisguised hostility to di idea from France, which was averse to seeing di Americans trying to butt into an area it considers its exclusive sphere of influence, dem review di concept of di ACRI.
In the review, which drew the expertise of American military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions midwifed by the American congress in secret sessions, the Americans considered and realised the need to set up an African command to add to the other commands already in place covering the various continents of the world.	For di review, wey draw di expertise of america Military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions wey di America congress carry kom for dem secret sessions, di Americans dem consider and realise di need to set up one AFrican command to add to di oda command wey don dey already and dey cover oda continent for inside di world.
Thus based on recommendations of these assemblage of experts drawn from all facets of American political and security establishments, Africom was set up by the Bush Junior administration with a wider mandate not just to contain Nigeria but also to keep an eye on the growing Chinese strategic penetration of Africa.
