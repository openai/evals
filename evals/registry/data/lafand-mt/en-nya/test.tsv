South Africa Urges Africa’s First COVID-19 Vaccine Plant to Keep Its Doors Open 	South Africa yapempha kuti kukhazikitsa kwa katemera woyamba wa COVID-19 wa mu Africa kupitilire.
South African health officials are urging COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Aspen to keep its plant in the Eastern Cape province open. This follows a Reuters article quoting Aspens senior director saying they may have to shut down as there have been no orders for their rebranded COVID vaccine. 	Adindo a zaumoyo ku South Africa apempha okonza katemera wa COVID-19, Aspen, kuti apitilize kutsegula malo awo mu dera la Eastern Cape. Izi zadza potengera nkhani yomwe a Reuters analemba kuti mkulu wa Aspen anali ndi ganizo lotseka malowa chifukwa choti katemera watsopanoyu samagulidwa.
A South African-owned subsidiary of pharmaceutical giant Aspen struck a deal with American company Johnson & Johnson in March to package, price, sell and distribute its vaccine in Africa. 	Nthambi yowona za mankhwala ya ku South Africa, ya Aspen, inagwirizana ndi kampani ya ku America ya Johnson & Johnson m'mwezi wa March kuti azilongedza, kuyika mitengo, kugulitsa komanso kugawa katemerayu mu Africa.
This vaccine was rebranded as Aspenovax. 	Katemerayu anakonzedwanso ndi kukhala Aspenovax.
The move was hailed by many as there had been much concern about Africas reliance on imported vaccines which were often costly and at times in short supply. 	Ganizoli linalandiridwa ndi anthu ambiri chifukwa panali madando oti Africa imadalira kuyitanitsa katemerayu kuchoka kunja zomwe zinali zokwera mtengo komanso katemerayu amakhala wosakwanira.
But there have been no orders for Aspenovax. South Africas National Health Department Spokesperson Foster Mohale said the lack of orders is due to low vaccination rates not only at home, but globally. 	Koma palibe yemwe akugula katemera wa Aspenovax. M'neneri wa National Health Department ku South Africa, a Foster Mohale, ati izi zachitika kamba ka kuchepa kwa anthu obayitsa katemerayu m'dzikomo komanso pa dziko lonse.
"""Vaccine hesitancy is one of the factors which contribute to these low vaccination rates or demand for more vaccines which also affect the production. Because obviously we understand that they are in a business, they cant keep on producing vaccines when they know that the demand for vaccines is very low. So, we understand the situation where they are, and we sympathize with them,"" he said. "	"""Kuzengereza kubayitsa katemerayu ndi chimodzi mwa zifukwa zomwe zikuchepetsa chiwerengero cha anthu obayitsa kapena kufuna katemera wochuluka zomwe zimakhudza kapangidwe. Chifukwa mwachidziwikire ife tikuwamvetsa kuti akuchita malonda choncho sangamakonze katemera wochuluka pamene akudziwa kuti omufuna ndi ochepa. Kotero ife tikuwamvetsa ndipo tili okhudzika,"" iwo anatero."
Mohale said for now, South Africa has enough vaccines. He adds that in March, 100,000 vaccines expired. And more are due to expire in June and July. 	A Mohale ati  pakali pano dziko la South Africa lili ndi katemera wokwanira. Iwo awonjezera kuti, m'mwezi wa March, katemera 100,000 anaonongeka ndipo wina wochuluka akuyembekezeka kuwonongeka m'mwezi wa June ndi July.
However, he said that Aspens vaccine plant is important because no one knows what the future holds. 	Komabe, iwo ati kukhazikitsidwa kwa katemera wa Aspen ndi kofunika popeza palibe yemwe amadziwa zobwera m'tsogolo.
"""We will try to engage them not to rush their decision precisely because we anticipate especially our scientists, our epidemiologists, we anticipate that the fifth wave might hit the country, South Africa, during the winter season which is a few weeks away from now. As you can see the number of daily COVID-19 patients has been rising for the past seven days,"" he said. "	"""Tiyesetsa kuwapempha kuti asapitilire ndi ganizoli chifukwa tikuyembekezera wodziwa sayansi ndi owona za kufala kwa matenda kuti mwina nyengo yachisanu ya COVID-19 ikhoza kufika ku South Africa pamene nyengo ya dzinja ikufika m'ma sabata akubwerawa. Monga mmene mukuwonera, chiwerengero cha anthu odwala COVID-19 chakhala chikukwera mmasiku asanu ndi awiri apitawo,"" iwo anatero."
Professor Petro Terblanche, who is the managing director of South African company, Afrigen, which in a continent-first made an mRNA COVID vaccine using Modernas data — said the situation at Aspen is a tragedy for the industry. 	Pulofesa Petro Terblanche, mkulu wa kampani ya ku South Africa yotchedwa Afrigen, yomwe inali yoyamba kukonza katemera wa COVID wotchedwa mRNA kugwiritsa ntchito Modernas data, wati zomwe zachitika ku Aspen ndi zodzetsa chiwopsezo pa malonda awo.
"""This is just indicating again how important it is that this continent looks at policy reform. This is about how are we going to make sure that we give preferential procurement to local companies. How are we going to make sure that we create a marketplace and eco-system that will absorb local capacity? Otherwise, we will not have capacity locally in a sustainable manner and were going to get the next pandemic and we will be unprepared, and we will not have health security,"" said Terblanche. "	"""Izi zikusonyeza kufunika kosintha malamulo mu Africa. Izi ndi zokhudzana ndi mmene tingaperekere mwayi kwa makampani ang'onoang'ono kuti tipange misika komanso njira yabwino yoti anthu azipezera katemerayu mosavuta. Tikapanda kutero, tidzavutika mliriwu ukadzabweranso,"" iwo anatero."
She believes money should also be put into educating people on the importance of vaccines. 	Iwo akukhulupilira kuti ndalama zikuyenera kugwiritsidwa ntchito pophunzitsa anthu za ubwino wa kayemerayu.
"""We need to ensure that we also put effort into advocacy for vaccination. Because we now have 17% of the continent that is vaccinated. We need to get them to at least 40% to ensure that we fully arrest this pandemic,"" she said. "	"""Tikuyenera kuwonetsetsa kuti tikuyesetsa kulimbikitsa ubwino wa katemerayu chifukwa pakali pano, anthu 17 pa 100 ali wonse ndi amene anabayitsa katemerayu mu Africa. Nambalayi ikuyenera kukula kufika pa anthu 40 pa 100 ali wonse kuti tithane ndi mliriwu,"" iwo anatero."
Mohale was unable to say when the Health Department would be meeting with Aspens executives. 	A Mohale anakanika kunena tsiku lomwe ofesi ya zaumoyo idzakumane ndi akuluakulu a Aspens.

"After a period of seeing its media attacked as ""fake news"" by former President Donald Trump, the United States retained a relatively high ranking of 42 in RSF's index.

Despite an overall trend of decline, Clayton said there are positives. 	Ngakhale pali kubwelera m'mbuyo, a Clayton ati pali chiyembekezo.

The community, which makes up 14% of Indias 1.4 billion population, is reeling from vilification by hard-line Hindu nationalists who have long espoused an anti-Muslim stance. Some leaders of Indias ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have tacitly supported the violence, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far been silent about it. Eid al-Fitr is typically marked with communal prayers, celebratory gatherings around festive meals and new clothes, but celebrations in India for the past two years have been marred by COVID-19 restrictions.

In Indian-controlled Kashmir, the Muslim festival has been subdued for the past three years because of an unprecedented military lockdown after India stripped the regions semi-autonomy in 2019, followed by the pandemic.

WHO Report Says COVID Cases Decline, Except in Americas, Africa 	Lipoti la WHO lati chiwerengero cha matenda a COVID chikutsika kupatula ku America ndi ku Africa.
The World Health Organization said Wednesday that the number of newly reported coronavirus cases and deaths globally continued to fall in the last week, continuing a decline that began in March. 	World Health Organization, lachitatu yanena kuti nambala ya anthu omwe akupezeka ndi corona virus komanso kumwalira padziko lonse ikupitilira kutsika msabata yatha, kupitiliza kutsika komwe kunayamba March.
In its weekly report on the pandemic, the U.N. health agency said there were about 3.8 million new infections and more than 15,000 deaths last week, a 17% and 3% drop on the week respectively. But those figures are believed to be a significant underestimate of COVID-19's true toll as increasing numbers of countries abandon widespread testing and surveillance. 	Mu lipoti lake la sabata iliyonse la mliriwu, nthambi ya U.N yoyang'anira umoyo yati pali anthu pafupifupi 3.8 miliyoni omwe apatsirana matendawa komanso anthu oposa 15,000 amwalira sabata yatha zomwe zapangitsa chiwerengerochi kutsika ndi 17% komanso 3%. Koma nambalayi ikuoneka kuti yachepetsedwa poyendera ndi zotsatira za COVID-19 pamene mayiko ochuluka anasiya kuyesa matendawa komanso kuyang'anira mayiko awo.
Still, WHO noted that cases rose by about a third in Africa and 13% in the Americas. There was also a nearly 70% jump in deaths reported in India, although that was attributed to delayed reporting rather than a recent surge of disease. 	Komabe WHO yapeza kuti chiwerengero cha odwala chakwera ndi magawo atatu pamene anthu 13 mwa 100 aliwonse ku America ali ndi matendawa. Pafupifupi anthu 70 pa 100 aliwonse amwaliraku India ngakhale akuti izi zili chomwechi kamba kotulutsa lipotili mochedwa osati kufala kwa matenda komwe kwachitika pompano.
Last week, authorities in South Africa said they had noted an uptick in COVID-19 cases attributable to the BA.4 mutant of omicron, although they said it was too early to tell if that would result in a significant new wave of disease. Although the BA.4 version of COVID-19's omicron variant appears more infectious than omicron, WHO said there was no evidence yet that it was leading to substantially higher rates of hospitalization or death. 	Sabata yatha, adindo a ku South Africa ati apeza kuti pali kukwera kwa chiwerengero cha anthu odwala mtundu wina wa COVID-19 wotchedwa BA.4 omicron ngakhale kuti pakali pano sangathe kunena ngati iyi ingakhale nyengo ina ya mliriwu. Ngakhale kuti BA.4 omicron COVID-19 ndiyosiyana komanso yofala kwambiri kuposa omicron, WHO yati palibe umboni woti mthendayi ndi yomwe ikuchititsa anthu ambiri kugonekedwa kuchipatala kapena kumwalira.
"Salim Abdool Karim, a public health expert at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said that while only a ""modest"" rise in cases had been noted, South Africa was also in the middle of a holiday period and testing had dropped significantly. He said the cases were slowing and were ""not following a rocket-like upward trajectory we would expect"" in another spike of disease. "	"Salim Abdool Karim, katswiri wa zaumoyo ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya KwaZulu-Natal, wati ngakhale pali chiwerengero chochepa cha odwala COVID, South Africa inali pakati pa tchuthi ndipo chiwerengero cha oyezetsa matendawa chinatsika. Iwo ati chiwerengerochi chimachepa ndipo, ""sichimakwera ngati mmene timayembekezera,"" pa matendawa."
At a press briefing on Wednesday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said it was too soon to tell if COVID-19 was entering a seasonal pattern and warned against countries dropping all of their restrictions too quickly — as many in the West have done. 	Pa msonkhano wa atolankhani womwe unachitika lachitatu, mkulu WHO woona za ngozi zadzidzidzi, Dr. Michael Ryan, ati osafulumira kunena kuti COVID-19 ikusintha kamba ka kusintha kwa nyengo ndipo achenjeza mayiko omwe asiya kutsata njira zopewera mnthendayi mwansanga monga mmene achitira mayiko a azungu.
"""The jury is still out as to how seasonal this virus will become,"" he said, explaining that it wasn't proven yet that COVID-19 would naturally drop off in the summer and that the world could yet face more unsettling variants. ""If people are crowded together in conditions where a new variant is spreading, you will see high levels of transmission,"" he said. "	"""Oweruza akufufuzabe ngati kachilombo koyambitsa matendawa kamasintha ndi nyengo,"" Iwo anatero kufotokoza kuti sizinatsimikidwe ngati chiwerengero cha odwala COVID-19 chingatsike m'nyengo yotentha kapena ngati tingawonenso kusintha. ""Ngati anthu angamachulukane mmalo omwe matenda atsopanowa akufala ndiye kuti chiwerengero chopatsirana chikhoza kukweranso,"" iwo anatero."
Meanwhile in China, authorities continued to crack down on cities, including Beijing, where more than 10% of the subway system was shut down in an effort to curb the virus' spread, after authorities in the capital already closed down indoor dining, gyms and school classes. 	Izi zili chomwechi, akuluakulu a ku China akupitilia kutseka mizinda kuphatikizapo Beijing komwe malo okwelera sitima 10 pa 100 aliwonse anatsekedwa pofuna kuchepetsa kufala kwa mthendayi komanso akuluakulu anatseka kale malo odyera, malo olimbitsira thupi komanso sukulu.
In Shanghai, rigid and widely derided restrictions have led to shortages of food and medical aid along with a wider — though likely temporary — impact on the national economy. Desperate, outraged citizens have confronted authorities at barricades and online, screamed out of their windows and banged pots and pans in a sign of frustration and anger. 	Ziletso zokhwima komanso zonyoza ku Shanghai zapangitsa kuti pakhale kuchepa kwa chakudya ndi thandizo la mankhwala komanso zili ndi zotsatira pa chuma cha dziko. Mzika zokwiya zafunsa akuluakulu kochoka mnyumba zawo komanso pa intaneti. Anthuwa amakuwa kuchoka m'mazenera  awo komanso kumenyetsa mapoto ngati chizindikiro chosonyeza kukwiya ndi kukhumudwa.

Erdogan Goes to Riyadh to Seal Rapprochement 	Erdogan apita ku Riyagh kukabwezeretsa ubale.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan heads to Saudi Arabia Thursday for a two-day visit aimed at easing old tensions between Ankara and Riyadh. 	Pulezidenti wa chi Turkish, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wapita ku Saudi Arabia lachinayi, pa ulendo wake wa masiku awiri womwe cholinga chake ndi kuthetsa udani womwe unali pakati pa Ankara ndi Riyadh.
The Turkish leaders visit with the Saudi king comes after years of rivalry between their once-close countries. 	Atsogoleri a chi Turkish ayendera mfumu ya ku Saudi patadutsa zaka mayikowa ali pa udani ngakhale anali pa ubwenzi kale.
Mehmet Ogutcu is the head of the London Energy Club, a grouping of government and energy sector leaders. Ogutcu says the visit is the culmination of intense international diplomacy. 	Mehmet Ogutchu ndi mkulu wa gulu la London Energy Club, lomwe ndi gulu la boma ndi atsogoleri a chigawo choyang'anira mphamvu. A Ogutcu ati ulendowu ulimbikitsa ubale wa pakati pa mayiko.
"""President Erdogan has good relations with the king; with the crown prince Muhammad Bin Salman, we had serious difficulties,"" said Ogutcu. ""Now it looks that I believe the*(Britons), and Americans, and the Qataris of course played some role, even the Azeris might have done this. And things are changing and relaxing a bit more, and now at the presidential level, it's going to be sealed."" "	"""Pulezidenti Erdogan ali pa ubale wabwino ndi a mfumu; tinali ndi mavuto aakulu ndi mwana wa mfumu, Muhammad Bin Salman,"" atero a Ogutcu. Tsopano zikuoneka kuti ndikukhulupilira kuti anthu a ku Briton, America ndi ku Qatar anatengapo gawo ngakhale anthu a ku Azeris akhoza kukhala kuti anachita izi. Zinthu zikusintha komanso kusiya kuvuta, tsopano chifukwa cha a pulezidenti izi zisindikizidwa."
Erdogan and the crown prince have been bitter rivals. The Turkish president led international condemnation over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed inside Saudi Arabias consulate in Istanbul. 	A Erdogan ndi mwana wa mfumu akhala pa udani woopsa. Pulezidenti wa chi Turkish ndi yemwe anatsogolera mayiko kudzudzula dziko la Saudi Arabia pa kuphedwa kwa mtolankhani wa ku Saudi, a Jamal Khaashoggi, yemwe anaphedwa mu ofesi ya ku Istanbul ku Saudi Arabia.
The killing was linked to the crown prince, a charge he denied. But the decision earlier this month to move the Khashoggi murder trial from Istanbul to Riyadh is seen as a gesture by Ankara, opening the way for Erdogan's visit. 	Mwana wa mfumuyi amakhudzidwa ndi imfayi koma iye anakana mlanduwu. Koma ganizo loti mlandu wa kuphedwa kwa Khashoggi ukazengedwe ku Istanbul kuchoka ku Riyadh ndi chisonyezo choti Ankara ikuwalandira a Erdogan pa ulendo wawo.
Ogutcu says with presidential elections due next year, Erdogan is looking for Saudi help to bail out the ailing Turkish economy. 	A Ogutcu ati pamene zisankho za pulezidenti zili chaka cha mawa, a Erdogan akufuna Saudi iwathandize kukweza chuma cha Turkish.
"""Turkey has an interest in reviving relations with Riyadh because Turkey needs financial support,"" said Ogutcu. ""The Turkish economy is not attracting any significant portfolio investments nor sovereign wealth funds coming to invest Turkey. But this will be a give-and-take package deal involving these countries. So, there are real economic and political security interests involved."" "	"""Turkey ikufuna kuyambitsanso ubale wake ndi Riyadh chifukwa dziko la Turkey likufuna thandizo la ndalama,"" anatero a Ogutcu. ""Chuma cha ku Turkish sichikukopa magulu ambiri  kapena anthu a chuma chawo kudzachita malonda m'dzikomo. Koma tsopano pakhala mgwirizano wopereka ndi kulandila pakati pa mayikowa. Kotero pali chuma komanso ndale zofunika chitetezo."""
Shared concerns over Iran's growing influence in the region -- along with its nuclear energy program -- provide important common ground between Riyadh and Ankara, says international relations professor Soli Ozel of Istanbul's Kadir Has University, especially as American attention is expected to pivot away from the Middle East and toward China. 	Pali kudandaula kuti ganizo la dziko la Iran lofuna kupitilira ndi kukhazikitsidwa kwa mphamvu ya nukiliya ndi komwe kukuyanjanitsa Riyadh ndi Ankara, a polofesa Soli Ozel a ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya Kadir yomwe ili ku Istanbul ndiwo ananena izi. Iwo anatinso, izi zili chomwechi makamaka pamene chidwi cha America chikuyembekezeka kuchoka ku mayiko a aluya kupita ku China.
"""Turkey does propose itself as a counterweight to Iran. Both countries have an interest along with all the western countries for Iran not to be as influential throughout the region as it is today,"" said Ozel. ""And the Iranians are also constantly sending signals that they are not going to let others draw them away from those countries - Iraq, Lebanon and Syria - where they have quite a lot of influence."" "	"""Dziko la Turkey limadziona ngati lili ndi mphamvu zambiri zoposera dziko la Iran. Mayiko onsewa pamodzi ndi mayiko onse a kwa azungu amafuna kuti dziko la Iran lisakhale ndi mphamvu m'chigawo chonse monga mmene zilili lero,"" anatero a Ozel. ""Anthu a ku Iran nawo akuwonetsa zizindikiro zosonyeza kuti salola kuti ena awachotse ku mayiko a Iraq, Lebanon ndi Syria, komwe ali ndi mphamvu."""
Erdogan's Saudi visit is part of a wider policy of seeking to repair relations across the region in a bid to end its isolation. The Turkish president has recently visited the United Arab Emirates and earlier this month hosted the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog. 	Ulendo wa a Erdgan wopita ku Saudi ndi gawo la lamulo lalikulu lofuna kukonzanso maubale m'chigawochi pofuna kuthetsa kudzipatula. Pulezidenti wa chi Turkish anayenderanso United Arab Emirates posachedwapa komanso kumayambiliro a mwezi uno analandira pulezident wa ku Israel, a Isaac Herzog.
But analyst Ozel warns Ankara is in a vulnerable position. 	Koma akatswiri Ozel wachenjeza kuti Ankara ili pachiopsezo.
"""Turkey alienated, insulted, offended a lot of countries with which it had at least decent relations. And they all recognize that this burst of diplomacy is coming out of weakness rather than strength,"" said Ozel. "	"""Dziko la Turkey linadzipatula, kunyoza komanso kukhumudwitsa mayiko ambiri omwe linali nawo pa ubale wabwino. Ndipo onsewa akuzindikira kuti mgwirizano wadzidzidziwu ukubwera kamba ka kufooka osati kulimbika kwa Turkey,"" anatero a Ozel."
But analysts say Ankara is banking on its importance as a potential bulwark to Iranian ambitions, a factor that may help overcome any remaining hostility among the neighbors it is trying to win back. 	Koma akastwiri ati Ankara ikutenga ubwino wake ngati kuthekera kodzimangira linga pofuna kudziteteza ku zofuna za Iran, njira yomwe ingathandize kuthana ndi udani pakati pa omwe ayandikana nawo kuti ubale ubwelere.
Executions, Detentions Hang Over Saudi Legal Reforms 	Kupha, komanso kumanga kutsalira kusintha kwa malamulo ku Saudi.
Saudi Arabia is pushing to revamp its harsh justice system but reforms are overshadowed by executions and tough treatment of dissidents, raising questions about how much will change. 	Saudi Arabia ikufuna kukonza malamulo ake a nkhanza koma kusinthaku kukutsekerezedwa ndi kupha komanso kuzunza otsutsa zomwe zikubweretsa mafunso odabwa kuti ndi zinthu ziti zomwe zitasinthe.
The kingdom is known for its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which forms the basis of its judicial system. 	Ufumuwu umadziwika ndi kutanthauzira kwake kwa lamulo la chisilamu la sharia lomwe ndi gwero la malamulo okhudzana ndi milandu.
But in recent months it has moved ahead with reforms that analysts say could make its courts function more like others in the Middle East. 	Koma m'miyezi yapitayi, dzikoli lapitilira ndi kusintha malamulo zomwe akatswiri ati zikhoza kupangitsa kuti makhothi awo azigwira ntchito ngati ena onse ku mayiko a aluya.
That effort hinges on a series of new laws for sensitive issues like women's divorce rights and judges' power to determine criminal sentences. 	Izi zagwirizana ndi m'ndandanda wa malamulo atsopano okhudza ufulu wa azimayi banja likatha komanso mphamvu ya oweruza milandu kupereka chigamulo kwa olakwa.
Announced last year by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the measures, including the first written penal code, appear to align with Saudi Arabia's goal of opening up to the world and softening its extremist image. 	Chaka chatha, mwana wa mfumu, Prince Mohammed bin Salman yemwe anadziika yekha pampando analengeza kuti njira zimenezi kuphatikizapo malamulo omwe analembedwa koyamba okhudzana ndi milandu komanso zilango zake, akufanana ndi cholinga cha Saudi Arabia chofuna kumasukira dziko ndi kuchotsa chithunzithunzi choyipa.
Even critics concede the changes could make Saudi courts more predictable, in some cases. 	Ngakhale otsutsa avomereza kuti kusinthaku kupangitsa zochitika ku ma Khothi a ku Saudi zizidziwika pena.
But there is no expectation that restrictions on free speech will ease, or that the legal system will treat more favorably perceived opponents of the government. 	Koma palibe chiyembekezo choti pakhala kufewetsa malamulo okhwima oletsa kuyankhula zakukhosi kapena ngati makhothi asiye kuwonetsa tsankho kwa omwe akuoneka kuti ndi otsutsa boma.
"And despite the reforms, authorities have simultaneously provided reminders of what gave Saudi Arabia its ruthless reputation in the first place, notably the mass execution of 81 men in a single day in March for offenses related to ""terrorism."" "	Pamene pali kusintha, pa nthawi yomweyo akuluakulu akukumbutsa zomwe zinachititsa kuti Saud Arabia ikhale ndi mbiri yankhanza, ndipo ati izi zili chomcho kamba ka kuphedwa kwa anthu 81 pa tsiku limodzi m'mwezi wa March pa milandu yokhudzana ndi ziwawa.
'Notorious' system 	Kachitidwe koyipa ka zinthu
Two new laws have already been approved by the Saudi Cabinet. One governs the admissibility of evidence, previously at the judges' discretion. 	Malamulo awiri atsopano avomerezedwa ndi boma la ku Saudi. Lamulo loyamba ndi lolola kupereka umboni wovomerezedwa ndi woweruza milandu.
The second, a family law, is to take effect in June. In a traditionally male-dominated system, it expands the rights of divorced women to alimony and custody of their children. 	Lamulo lachiwiri ndi lokhudza mabanja lomwe liyambe kugwira ntchito mu June. Kutengera pachikhalidwe chomwe abambo amalamula, lamuloli likutambasula ufulu wa amayi wolandila malipiro komanso kusunga ana banja likatha.
"Announcing the new law in March, Prince Mohammed said it represented ""a major qualitative leap"" for women's rights and ""family stability."" "	"Polengeza za lamulo latsopano m'mwezi wa March, Prince Mohammed ati lamuloli likusonyeza ""kusintha kwakukulu"" pa ufulu wa amayi  ndi ""kulimba kwa mabanja."""
The reforms seem partly to cater to foreign firms whose investment the kingdom is courting, said Adel al-Saeed, vice president of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights. 	Wachiwiri kwa mtsogoleri wa bungwe la European Saudi Organization for Human Rights, a Adel al-Saeed, ati  kusinthaku mbali ina kupereka mpata kwa ochita malonda a m'mayiko ena omwe zotsatira zake ndi zomwe ufumuwu ukufuna.
"""The owners of capital are afraid of investing in this country, which is notorious in the legal aspect, so these laws are intended to change the image,"" he said. "	"""Eni ake a mpamba amachita mantha kudzachita malonda m'dziko lino lomwe lili ndi malamulo ankhanza, kotero malamulowa akufuna kusintha zimenezi,"" iwo anatero."
The new penal code, yet to be unveiled, could bring further dramatic changes. 	Malamulo atsopano okhudza milandu ndi zilango zake, omwe pakalipano sanadziwike, akhoza kupitiliza kubweretsa kusintha.
Under sharia, only apostasy, theft, revolt, armed robbery, adultery, drinking alcohol and slander carry prescribed sentences. Judges are left to determine punishment in other cases. 	Pansi pa lamulo la sharia, milandu ya mpakuto pa chipembedzo, kuba, kuwukira, kuba ndi mfuti, chigololo, kumwa mowa ndi kunyozana ndi yomwe ili zigamulo zake zodziwikiratu. Milandu ina yonse woweruza milandu ndi omwe amasankha zilango zake.
"With a penal code in place, ""the state will expect judges to rely not on their own training in sharia but instead on the legal rules (based on sharia) approved by the state,"" said Nathan Brown, an academic at George Washington University. "	"Pamene pali malamulo a milandu ndi zilango zake, ""boma likuyembekeza kuti woweruza milandu sazidalira kuphunzira kwawo kwa lamulo la sharia, koma malamulo (omwe gwero lake ndi lamulo la sharia) ovomerezedwa ndi boma,"" anatero a Nathan Brown, wophunzira ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya George Washington."
"""As a result, Saudi Arabia will look much more like a civil law system, much like most states in the region,"" said Brown, who has studied the Saudi reforms. "	"""Zotsatira zake ndi zoti Saudi Arabia iwoneka ngati dziko la malamulo okhudza anthu, monga maboma ena onse m'chigawochi,"" atero a Brown omwe anaphunzira za malamulo atsopano a ku Saudi."
"The result should be more ""predictability,"" said Abdullah Alaoudh, a U.S.-based legal expert and government critic, as new rules ""take away from the leeway ... that the judges used to have."" "	"Zotsatira zake zikhale ""zodziwika,"" anatero a Abdullah Alaoudh, katswiri wa malamulo komanso otsutsa boma omwe amakhala ku U.S, pamene malamulo atsopano ""akutenga ufulu umene woweruza milandu anali nawo."""
"But tighter regulation by the monarchy also ""creates a larger problem: lack of independence,"" he added. "	"Koma malamulo okhwima opangidwa ndi mafumu ""amabweretsa vuto lalikulu: kusadziyimira panokha,"" iwo anawonjezera."
The king is the head of the Saudi judiciary and acts as the final court of appeal. 	Mfumu ndiye mtsogoleri wa makhothi a ku Saudi ndipo amakhala ngati khothi lalikulu lochitila apilu.
Alaoudh's own father, prominent cleric Salman al-Awdah, has been held since 2017, seemingly in retaliation for a Twitter post that clashed with Saudi Arabia's policy at the time of isolating Qatar. 	Bambo awo a Alaoudh, a Salman al-Awdah, womwe ndi wansembe wodziwika, akhala atamangidwa kuchoka mu 2017 kamba koyankha zosagwirizana ndi lamulo la Saudii Arabia pa tsamba la mchezo la Twitter, panthawi yomwe dzikoli limadzipatula ku dziko la Qatar.
He is one of many detained in an apparent crackdown on dissent and those who could challenge Prince Mohammed's power. 	Iwo ndi mmodzi mwa ambiri omwe anamangidwa mwankhanza kamba kotsutsa pamodzi ndi  omwe amapikisana ndi mphamvu za mwana wa mfumu, Mohammed.
One of the most prominent examples is former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the CIA ally respected in the West for his efforts to counter violent extremism, but who King Salman ousted from the line of succession. 	Chimodzi mwa zitsanzo zodziwika bwino ndi mwana wamfumu Mohammed bin Nayef yemwe anagwirizanitsa CIA, komanso amalemekezedwa ndi mayiko a azungu chifukwa choyesetsa kuthana ndi nkhanza ngakhale mfumu Salman anamuchotsa pa ndandanda wa anthu otenga ufumu.
Prince Nayef has not been seen in public since reports of his arrest in March 2020. His detention was never officially confirmed. 	Mwana wa mfumu Nayef wakhala asakuoneka ku gulu la anthu kuchokera m'mwezi wa March pamene kunatuluka lipoti loti wamangidwa. Koma kumangidwa kwake sikunatsimikizidwe.
Shadow of Khashoggi 	Chithunzithunzi cha Khashoggi.
For government opponents, such cases reinforce questions about what difference the ongoing justice reforms will make. 	Kwa anthu otsutsa boma, milandu ngati imeneyi imadzetsa mafunso kuti ndi kusintha kwanji komwe malamulo omwe akonzedwawa kungabweretse.
"""In my view, this is all window-dressing,"" said Madawi al-Rasheed, a U.K.-based academic and spokesperson for the opposition National Assembly Party founded by exiles. "	"""Ine ndikuona kuti izi ndi zachionetsero chabe,"" anatero a Madawi al-Rasheed, omwe amakhala ku U.K, omwenso ndi wophunzira komanso m'neneri wa chipani chotsutsa cha National Assembly chomwe chinayambitsidwa ndi anthu othamangitsidwa kwawo."
"""It's very, very difficult to see what the meaning is of these reforms apart from the project of portraying (Prince Mohammed) as a reformer."" "	"""Ndizovuta kwambiri kupeza tanthauzo la malamulo osinthidwawa kupatula kuti ndi ntchito yofuna kuwonetsa mwana wa mfumu, Mohammed, ngati munthu wosintha zinthu."""
Hanging over any discussion of justice and legal reform in Saudi Arabia is the 2018 murder and dismemberment of critic and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate. 	Nkhani yomwe ikumveka pakakambidwa za chilungamo ndi kukonza malamulo ku Saudi Arabia ndi nkhani ya kuphedwa ndi kudulidwa ziwalo kwa wotsutsa komanso wolemba nkhani, a Jamal Khashoggi, m'chaka cha 2018 ku ofesi ya ufumu ku Istanbul.
"A U.S. intelligence assessment found Prince Mohammed himself ""approved"" an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, though Saudi officials deny this and say it was a ""rogue"" operation. "	"A.U.S itafufuza yapeza kuti mwawa wa mfumu Mohammed ""anavomereza"" kuti za kugwidwa kapena kuphedwa kwa a Khashoggi, ngakhale adindo a ku Saudi atsutsa izi ponena kuti zomwe zinachitikazi zinali zochotsa ulemu."
In April, before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Riyadh on Thursday and embraced Prince Mohammed, Turkey transferred the trial in absentia of 26 suspects in the Khashoggi case to Saudi Arabia. 	M'mwezi wa April, mtsogoleri wa ku Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, asanapite ku Riyadh ndi kukumbatira mwana wa mfumu, Mohammed, lachinayi, dziko la Turkey linasamutsira mlandu wa a Khashoggi ku Saudi Arabia popanda mboni 26.
Turkey's decision drew anguished protest from lawyers and Khashoggi's fiancée, who insisted Saudi courts couldn't possibly hold a credible trial. 	Chiganizo cha dziko la Turkey chinapangitsa kuti maloya okhudzidwa ndi bwenzi la a Khashoggi achite zionetsero ponena kuti ma khothi a ku Saudi sangapereke chigamulo mwachilungamo.
For the loved ones of those locked away, Khashoggi's killing fuels a uniform fear of speaking out. 	Kwa omwe okondedwa awo anatsekeredwa kundende, kuphedwa kwa a Khashoggi kwabweretsa mantha okanika kuyankhulapo.
"""I want to, many do, but we're scared,"" said a friend of Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, who has been detained along with his father since 2018. "	"""Ndikufuna kuyankhula, ambiri akufuna kutero, koma tili ndi mantha,"" anatero mnzake wa mwana wa mfumu Salman bin Abdulaziz, yemwe wakhala kundende pamodzi ndi bambo ake kuchoka m'chaka cha 2018."
"""Everyone knows what happened to Khashoggi."" "	"""Aliyense akudziwa zomwe zinawachitikira a Khashoggi."""
Moroccan Prison Program Sets Out to De-Radicalize IS Veterans 	Ndondomeko ya kundende ya ku Morocco ikufuna kusintha nkhalakale za IS.
"As a combatant for the Islamic State group who left his native Morocco to join what he felt was a holy fight in Syria, Mohsin says he saw all the horrors of war. ""A terrifying experience,"" he says. "	"Msilikari wa gulu la Islamic State yemwe anachoka kwawo ku Morocco ndi cholinga chokamenya nawo nkhondo yoyera (yachilungamo) ku Syria, a Mohsin, ati anaona zoopsa zonse za nkhondo. ""Zinali zinthu zochititsa mantha,"" iwo anatero."
Now a prisoner, the 38-year-old claims he is no longer the fanatic he was then, enraged with a murderous hatred for non-Muslims. Captured in Turkey and extradited to Morocco, he is serving a 10-year prison term on terrorism charges. 	A Mohsin a zaka 38 omwe pano ndi mkaidi ati tsopano alibe chidwi ngati mmene analili kale, wodzadza ndi mkwiyo komanso wofuna kupha onse omwe si asilamu. Iwo anagwidwa ku Turkey ndipo anawasamutsira ku Morocco komwe anagamulidwa kukakhala kundende kwa zaka khumi pa mlandu wochita ziwawa.
Now the former fighter has graduated with 14 other prisoners convicted of terror offenses from a Morocco de-radicalization program that might make them more eligible for an early release. 	Msilikari wakaleyu pamodzi ndi akaidi ena 14, omwenso ali kundende pa mlandu wochita ziwawa, amaliza maphunziro awo kuchokera ku ndondomeko ya ku Morocco yofuna kusintha anthu yomwe ingawapangitse kukhala oyenera kutulutsidwa mwansanga.
The Associated Press and other media were invited to observe their graduation ceremony Thursday in a prison in Sale near the Moroccan capital, Rabat, and to interview some prisoners under monitored and controlled conditions. Prison administration officials picked out three men they said were willing to be interviewed. 	Associated Press ndi wofalitsa nkhani ena anayitanidwa kukakhala nawo pa mwambo wotsiliza maphunzirowa womwe unachitika lachinayi kufupi ndi mzinda wa Morocco ku Rabat, komanso kukafunsa mafunso akaidi ena omwe akuyang'aniridwa. Adindo oyang'anira ndende anasankha anthu atatu omwe anali okonzeka kufunsidwa mafunso.
Officials stipulated that the inmates shouldn't be identified by their full names and that their faces mustn't be shown, citing privacy reasons. 	Akuluakulu anapempha kuti akaidiwa asatchulidwe mayina komanso asawaonetse nkhope pofuna kuwasungira chinsinsi.
But prison officials didn't listen to the interviews or intervene to shut down media lines of questioning or inmates' answers. 	Koma akuluakulu a ndende sanamvere nawo pomwe akaidi amafunsidwa mafunso ngakhale kulowelera mafunso oyenera kufunsidwa ndi wofalitsa nkhani kapena mayankho a akaidi.
The 15 inmates in crisp shirts and trousers stood solemnly for Morocco's national anthem and were handed certificates. Prison officials said the de-radicalization program consisted of three months of classes in prison on religion, law and economics, and that inmates also received training on how to start a business. These most recent graduates were the ninth batch since the program started in 2017. 	Akaidi 15 atavala malaya ndi mabuluku oyera bwino anayima chiliri poyimba nyimbo ya fuko la Morocco ndipo anapatsidwa zikalata zosonyeza kumaliza maphunziro. Akuluakulu a ndende ati ndondomeko yosintha anthuyi yachitika kwa miyezi itatu pomwe akaidi amalowa mkalasi kundende komweko, kuphunzira za chipembedzo, malamulo ndi zachuma. Iwo atinso akaidiwa aphunzira mmene angayambire kuchita malonda. Omwe atsiriza maphunzirowa kumene ndi gulu la chisanu ndi zinayi kochokera nthawi yomwe ndondomekoyi inayamba mu 2017.
"Moulay Idriss Agoulmam, the director of social-cultural action and prisoner reintegration at Morocco's prison administration, said the program is entirely voluntary and works with inmates ""to change their behavior and improve their life path."" "	"Mkulu woyang'anira maubale ndi chikhalidwe komanso kubwezeretsa akaidi kwawo, a Moulay Idris Agoulmam omwenso ndi mmodzi wa ogwira ntchito ku ndende ya Morocco, ati ndondomekoyi siyokakamiza komanso imachitika kwa akaidi okha, ""kuti asinthe khalidwe ndi kusintha njira ya moyo wawo."""
"""It enables prisoners to form an awareness of the gravity of their mistakes,"" he said. "	"""Zimathandiza akaidi kuzindikira kukula za kulakwa zawo,"" iwo anatero."
Graduating from the program doesn't make inmates automatically eligible for early release, but does increase their chances of getting a royal pardon or a reduced sentence. That's been the case for just over half the program's 222 graduates so far, the prison administration says. Since 2019, the training has also been offered to women convicted under Morocco's Anti-Terrorism Act. Ten women have graduated so far — all of them since released, including eight with pardons. 	Kumaliza maphunzirowa sikutanthauza kuti akaidi atuluka nsanga koma kuwonjezera mwayi wotulutsidwa ndi a mfumu kapena kuchotseredwa zaka. Woyang'anira ndende ati izi ndi zomwe zakhala zikuchutika kwa theka la anthu 222 omwe amaliza maphunziro a ndondomekoyi. Kuyambira mchaka cha 2019, maphunzirowa amaperekedwa kwa amayi omwe anali kundende pa mlandu wochita ziwawa, kutengera ndi lamulo lotsutsana ndi ziwawa la Morocco's Anti-Terrorism Act. Amayi khumi ndi omwe anamaliza maphunzirowa ndipo anatulutsidwa kundende ndipo asanu ndi anayi anakhululukiridwa milandu yawo.
"Called ""Moussalaha,"" meaning ""reconciliation"" in Arabic, the program is offered to prisoners who have demonstrated a readiness to disavow extremism.

"Mohsin said he left to fight in Syria in 2012. A school dropout as a teen, he said he ""was virtually illiterate and couldn't discern good from bad."" He said he was radicalized by people who showed him extremist videos ""about the divine obligation to battle those who don't follow Islamic principles and to murder non-Muslims."" "	"A Mohsin ati anapita kukamenya nkhondo ku Syria mu 2012.

Iran Gets Opportunity to Sell Auto Parts to Russian Carmaker 	Iran ipeza mwayi wogulitsa zida kwa wokonza galimoto wa ku Russia.
A member of Iran's syndicate of car parts manufacturers says Iranian producers have an opportunity to export their wares to a Russian carmaker, state media reported. 	Lipoti la wofalitsa nkhani a boma lati, membala wa gulu la makampani lokonza zida za galimoto ku Iran, wati okonzawa ali ndi mwayi wotumiza katundu wawo kwa wokonza galimoto ku Russia.
"The late Monday report quoted Hossein Bahrainian as saying ""a prominent Russian car maker"" requested parts from Iran. He did not name the manufacturer. He said it requested brake parts, airbags, air-conditioner parts and other components. "	"Lipoti lomwe latuluka lolemba madzulo lati a Hossein Bahrainian anena kuti ""wokonza galimoto wodziwika wa ku Russia"" wapempha zida kuchoka ku Iran. Iwo sanamutchule wokonzayu. Iwo atinso okonza galimotoyu wapemphanso zida zoyimitsira galimoto, zopewera ngozi, zobweretsera mphepo yabwino ndi zida zina zazikulu."
Both Iran and Russia are under U.S. sanctions but the export of Iranian cars and car parts is not subject to sanctions. 	Mayiko a Iran ndi Russia ali pansi pa chilango cha U.S koma kugulitsa galimoto ndi zida za galimoto sikukhudzana ndi chilangochi.
The import of automobiles to Iran is also not subject to sanctions. However, Tehran has not imported cars since 2018, after the U.S. withdrew from a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed oil and banking sanctions on Iran. 	Kubweretsa galimoto ku Iran sikukukhudzananso ndi chilangochi. Komabe, mzinda wa Tehran sunabweretse galimoto kuchoka mu 2018 pamene dziko la U.S linachoka mu pangano la nukiliya pakati pa Iran ndi World Powers ndikupereka zilango pa mafuta ndi banki pa dziko la Iran.
Western nations stopped exporting to Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. 	Mayiko a kwa azungu anasiya kugulitsa ku Russia kuchokera nthawi imene Russia inalowa ku Ukraine mwaupandu.
Iran in recent years has exported car radiators and suspension systems to Russia. In the past it exported cars to Iraq, Syria and Venezuela. 	Mu zaka zadutsazi, Iran yagulitsa ma ladiyeta ndi mateyala a galimoto ku Russia. M'buyomo amagulitsa galimoto ku Iraq, Syria ndi Venezuela.
Tehran and Moscow have had close relations in recent years, especially after Iran's sole nuclear power plant went online in 2011 with help from Russia. 	Mzinda wa Tehran ndi mzinda wa Moscow anali paubale waukulu mu zaka zapitazi makamaka pamene Russia inathandiza Iran kuyika pa intaneti ntchito yake yokhazikitsa mphamvu za nulikiya.
Separately on Tuesday, Iran said it has played a mediatory role in the war in Ukraine. 	Mwapadera lachiwiri, Iran yati inatengapo gawo lokhala mkhalapakati pa nkhondo ya Ukraine.
"""So far twice I have conveyed messages from the foreign minister of Ukraine to my Russian counterpart,"" said Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian in a phone conversation with his Irish counterpart. He said Iran supports diplomatic solutions for restoring peace and stability. "	"""Kufikira pano, ndapereka uthenga wochokera kwa nduna yoona zakunja ku Ukraine kupita kwa anzanga a ku Russia, kawiri konse,"" anatero nduna yoona zakunja a Hossein Amir Abdollahian pa lamya ndi mnzawo wa ku Iris. Iwo ati Iran ikuthandiza kupeza mayankho obwezeretsera mtendere ndi bata."
"Abdollahian did not elaborate but said Iran ""opposes war and displacement of human beings in Ukraine,"" and other paces like Yemen, the Palestinian lands and Afghanistan. "	"A Abdollahian sanatsindike koma anangoti Iran ""ikutsutsana ndi nkhondo komanso kusamuka kwa anthu ku Ukraine,"" ndi malo ena monga ku Yemen, malo a ku Palestine ndi Afghanistan."
Diversity, New Perspectives Are Applied to Middle East Coverage 	Njira zosiyanasiyana zatsopano zikugwiritsidwa ntchito ku mayiko a aluya pofalitsa nkhani.
Natalia Sancha has always adopted a collaborative approach to journalism. When out on assignment, she speaks to others covering the same story about their perspectives. 	Natalia Sancha anasankha kugwira ntchito ndi anthu ena ngati njira yochitila utolankhani. Akapita kukagwira ntchito, iwo amayankhula ndi ena omwe akulemba nkhani yomweyo kuti amve mbali yawo.
This partly stems from an interest in telling underreported stories, but as a female journalist in a male-dominated region, she says collaboration and supporting the women she works with have always been important. 	Mbali ina, izi zikuchitika chifukwa chofuna kuyankhulapo pa nkhani zomwe sizimakambidwa, koma ngati wolemba nkhani wamkazi mu chigawo chomwe abambo akulamula, iwo ati kugwirizana ndi kuthandiza amayi omwe amagwira nawo ntchito kwakhala kofunika.
"""I would talk to male and female journalists, and I always realized that women had a similar perspective, because we had similar experiences while covering the story,"" the 42-year-old journalist said. "	"""Ndimatha kuyankhula ndi wolemba nkhani aakazi komanso aamuna ndipo ndimazindikira kuti akazi amaganiza komanso kuona zinthu mofanana akamalemba nkhani,"" anatero wofalitsa nkhaniyu yemwe ali ndi zaka 42."
That collaborative approach came into play in 2020 when a publisher asked Sancha if she was interested in writing a book about Syria. 	Ganizo lochita mgwirizanowu linabwera mu 2020 pamene wosindikiza mabuku anawafunsa a Sancha ngati ali ndi chidwi cholemba bukhu lokhudzana ndi Syria.
She countered with a better offer. 	Iwo anatsutsa izi ndipo anapereka ganizo lina labwino.
"""I told him that a collective narrative by women journalists about the broader region would have a different effect,"" she said. ""I could have written the book myself, but it would not have the same sense."" "	"""Ndinawauza kuti kutolera nkhani zambiri za wolemba nkhani achikazi zokhudzana ndi chigawo chachikulu, kukhoza kubweretsa zotsatira zina,"" iwo anatero. ""Ndikanatha kulemba bukhuli ndekha, koma silikanamveka chimodzimodzi."""
Originally from Andalusia in southern Spain, Sancha spent the past 14 years in the Middle East covering conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and reporting from Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia. 	A Sancha omwe kwawo ndi ku Andalusia, ku m'mwera kwa Spain, akhala ku mayiko a aluya kwa zaka 14 zapitazo, kulemba nkhani zokhudza kusamvana ku Iraq, Syria ndi Yemen komanso kuchita lipoti kuchokera ku Egypt, Lebanon ndi Tunisia.
She has been working more recently with the European Union communications department, after leaving Beirut for health reasons following a mass explosion that rocked the city in 2020. 	Masiku apitawa, iwo akhala akugwira ntchito kwambiri ndi chigawo cha mauthega ku European Union, atachoka ku Beirut kamba ka mavuto a zaumoyo omwe anayambika chifukwa cha mabomba omwe anaphulitsidwa mu mzindawu m'chaka cha 2020.
"Women ""have a different experience because we would go to places that our male colleagues were not used to. Not because we're smarter, but just because the majority of the region is still Arab, Muslim and gender-segregated,"" Sancha told VOA. "	"Akazi ""akudziwa zambiri chifukwa timatha kupita malo omwe abambo ogwira nawo ntchito sanazolowele. Osati chifukwa ndife anzeru koma chifukwa anthu ambiri m'chigawochi akanali a mtundu wa chi Arab, asilamu komanso amasiyanitsa amayi ndi abambo,"" a Sancho anawuza VOA."
Having women reporters has an impact, she noted. 	Iwo anazindikira kuti kukhala ndi atolankhani aakazi kuli ndi ubwino.
"""If I put myself in the position of the reader, I would prefer to have a woman telling me the story because it is going to be about 100 percent of the population, which means you are going to have a more inclusive narrative on the conflict."" "	"""Nditakhala wowerenga nkhani, ndikhoza kukonda kuti wofotokoza nkhaniyo akhale mzimayi chifukwa ikhala yokhudzana ndi chiwerengero chonse, zomwe zikutanthauza kuti mu nkhaniyi mukhala zonse zokhudzana ndi kusamvana."""
For her book, Sancha reached out to other women who cover the Middle East, to ensure diverse perspectives from foreign and local reporters. 	Mu bukhu lawo, a Sancha anafikira amayi ena omwe amalemba nkhani ku mayiko aluya, pofuna kuwonetsetsa kuti pali maganizo osiyanasiyana kuchoka kwa atolankhani akunja ndi apafupi.
The result of the nearly two-year collaboration is Bullets for All, released in Spanish in April. 	Zotsatira za mgwirizano wa pafupifupi zaka ziwiri ndi Bullets for All, yomwe inatulutsidwa m'mwezi wa April ku Spain.
"In the book, ""we tell one story with different voices that represent all the women"" from the region, Sancha said. "	"Mu bukhuli, ""anthu osiyanasiyana akufotokoza nkhani imodzi yomwe ikuyimira amayi onse,"" a m'chigawochi, anatero a Sancho."
Each offers a personal perspective on covering historic moments, including the collapse of autocratic governments, popular protest movements and war. It also examines the discrimination and harassment women face in the newsroom and on assignment. 	Aliyense amapereka maganizo ake pa kulemba nkhani za mbiri yakale kuphatikizapo kugwa kwa ulamuliro wa chipani chimodzi, ziwonetsero ndi nkhondo. Bukhuli likuwunikanso kusalidwa ndi nkhanza zomwe amayi amakumana nazo ku ma ofesi olemba nkhani komanso pogwira ntchito.
Making connections 	Kuchita mgwirizano.
Understanding language and culture goes a long way toward making progress in the region, says Maya Gebeily. The Reuters bureau chief for Lebanon, Syria and Jordan is one of the contributors to the book. 	"Kumvetsa chiyankhulo ndi chikhalidwe kumathandiza kupita chitsogolo m'chigawochi,"" anatero a Maya Gebeily. Iwo monga mkulu wa ofesi ya The Reuters ku Lebanon, Syria ndi Jordan anathandiza nawo pa bukhuli."
"""There's a lot to say and show from the perspective of women reporters who were also then influenced by the women that they met as they were doing their reporting,"" she said. "	"""Pali zambiri zofuna kunena ndi kuwonetsa kuchoka ku mbali ya atolankhani aakazi omwe anasintha chifukwa cha amayi omwe amakumana nawo pamene amachita utolankhani,"" iwo anatero."
Born in the U.S. to Lebanese parents, Gebeily started her journalism career in 2013 with a local news site in Beirut, Lebanon. She went on to cover the region for Agence France-Presse before joining Reuters. 	A Gebeily, omwe anabadwa kwa makolo a chi Lebanise ku U.S, anayamba ntchito yawo yolemba nkhani mu 2013 ku ma ofesi olemba nkhani ku Beirut ku Lebanon. Iwo anapita m'chigawochi kukagwilira ntchito Agence France-Presse asapite ku Reuters.
Gebeily said her American and Lebanese background helped her understand the region better, which in turn has shaped her reporting. Knowing the local language is an important part of that. 	A Gebeily ati kukhala wa mtundu wa chi American ndi Lebanese kwawathandiza kumvetsa bwino chigawochi komanso kwasintha utolankhani wawo. Kudziwa chiyankhulo ndi gawo lofunikira la zimenezi.
"""When interviewing a minister or a displaced person or an activist, the most important element is getting their trust,"" she said. ""If you're able to speak the language and make them feel comfortable from the beginning, it changes everything. It grants you a very beautiful kind of access."" "	"""Pofunsa mafunso nduna, munthu wothawa kwawo kapena wofuna kusintha zinthu, chinthu chofunika kwambiri ndi kupeza chikhulipliro chawo,"" iwo anatero. ""Kutha kuyankhula chiyankhulo chawo ndi kuwapangitsa kuti akhale omasuka, kumasintha kalikonse. Izi zimapereka mwayi wabwino."
In addition to Iraq and Lebanon, Gebeily, 30, has also traveled to Syria to cover the war against the Islamic State (IS) militant group. 	Kuwonjezera Iraq ndi Lebanon, a Gebeily a zaka 30, anapitako ku Syria kukalemba nkhani zokhudza nkhondo yolimbana ndi gulu la zigawenga la Islamic State (IS)
"""Ive been very privileged to access some communities directly without having to work with a translator or a fixer, which also shapes the way that the stories come out,"" she said. "	"""Ndakhala ndi mwayi woyankhula ndi anthu mwachindunji m'madera ena popanda wotanthauzira kapena wothandizira,zomwenso zimathandiza mmene nkhani zitulukire,"" iwo anatero."
Syrian-Kurdish journalist Khabat Abbas, who has covered the war in Syria, attests to the importance of that. 	Wolemba nkhani wa mtundu wa chi Syrian-Kurdish, a Khabat Abbas, omwe analemba nkhani za nkhondo ya ku Syria, akuvomereza za kufunika kwa izi.
"""Its knowing the language and the culture that gives people a sense of comfort to open up to you,"" she told VOA from Qamishli, Syria. "	"""Kudziwa chiyankhulo ndi chikhalidwe ndi komwe kumapangitsa anthu kuti akumasukire ndi kukuuza zinthu,"" iwo anawuza VOA kuchoka ku Qamishli, ku Syria."
That knowledge helped when Abbas, 34, was on assignment with Sancha in March 2021. They traveled to a Kurdish-run detention camp in northeast Syria and interviewed female jihadists affiliated with IS, for a story in El Pais. 	Kudziwa kumeneku kunathandiza pamene a Abbas a zaka 34, anakagwira ntchito ndi a Sancha mu March, 2021. Iwo anapita ku malo osungira anthu ku Kurdish, kumpoto kwa Syria, kukafunsa mafunso akazi omwe amamenya nawo nkhondo yoyera (yachilungamo) yokhudzana ndi IS, kuti alembe nkhani mu El Pais.
"""While in Qamishli [in northeast Syria], I ran into two British journalists, very good colleagues of mine, who were disappointed after Shamima Begum and other women at the camp refused to talk to them,"" Sancha said, referring to a young woman who left her home in Britain aged 15 to join IS. "	"""Pamene ndinali ku Qamashli (kumpoto kwa Syria), ndinakumana ndi wolemba nkhani komanso anzanga a chi British awiri, omwe anali okhumudwa kuti Shamima Begum ndi akazi ena kumaloku anakana kuyankhula nawo,"" anatero a Sancha kutanthauza mtsikana yemwe anachoka kwawo ku Britain ali ndi zaka 15 kukalowa gulu la IS."
"""Their fixer was a man, so the jihadist women didnt talk to them because they are radical, and they dont talk to men. But then I was able to sit with Shamima and other women, who gave fantastic interviews from inside their tents,"" Sancha said. "	"""Yemwe amawathandiza anali munthu wabambo kotero akazi omenya nkhondowa sanayankhule nawo chifukwa anasintha ndipo sayankhula ndi anthu aamuna. Koma ine ndinakhala pansi ndi Shamima komanso akazi ena omwe anayankha bwino mafunso mkati mwa hema wawo,"" anatero a Sancha."
Abbas had a role in getting to talk to those women, she added. 	A Abbas anali ndi gawo kuti ayankhule ndi amayiwa, iwo anawonjezera.
Unlike Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas grew up in the marginalized Kurdish region of Syria, where until the war began in 2011, journalism effectively didnt exist. 	Kusiyana ndi a Sancha ndi a Gebeily, a Abbas anakulira ku chigawo chaching'ono cha Kurdish komwe kunalibe kulemba nkhani kufikira nthawi yomwe nkhondo inayamba mu 2011.
"""Ordinary people in our region were used to seeing women pick up arms and fight, but they werent used to seeing a woman hold a camera on the streets and on front lines,"" Abbas said. ""It took a lot of sacrificing for me to convince my family and society that Im as good, if not better, as my male colleagues."" "	"""Anthu m'chigawochi anazolowera kuwona amayi akutenga zida ndi kumenya nkhondo osati kuwona amayi atatenga chojambulira munsewu kapena akuyima patsogolo, "" anatero Abbas. ""Zinatengera kudzipereka kuti banja ndi dera langa atsimikize kuti ndimachita zinthu bwino mwinanso kuposera anzanga achimuna omwe ndimagwira nawo ntchito."
Journalism appealed to her because the story of the Middle East has often been told by male journalists, both local and foreign. 	Kulemba nkhani kunawasangalatsa chifukwa nkhani za mayiko aluya zimakambidwa ndi wolemba nkhani achimuna, pafupi ngakhalenso kunja.
"""The narrative hasnt changed because of that, but if local and international women journalists get a real chance to tell the story of the Middle East, that narrative could change, which would affect the way others see this region,"" Abbas said. "	"""Kulemba nkhani sikunasinthe chifukwa cha izi, ngati amayi olemba nkhani a konkuno komanso kunja angapatsidwe mwayi wolemba nkhani za mayiko aluya, kalembedwe ka nkhani kakhoza kusintha, zomwenso zingasinthe mmene anthu ena amawonera chigawo chino,"" anatero a Abbas."
Sancha also believes women in journalism have an impact on the way issues are viewed in the region, including post-traumatic stress disorder and the effect it has on female health, and subjects such as violence and alcohol. 	A Sancha akukhulupilira kuti amayi olemba nkhani ndiwokhudzidwa ndi mmene anthu amaonera zinthu m'chigawochi, kuphatikizapo kukhala ndi maganizo oopsa kamba ka zomwe zinachitika ndi zotsatira zake pa umoyo wa amayi komanso pa ziwawa ndi mowa.
"""We talk about all these issues that men normally wouldnt not speak about,"" she said. "	"""Timakamba zinthu zomwe abambo samayankhulapo,"" iwo anatero."
Iran's Guards Commander Says Israel Creating Conditions for Own Destruction 	Mkulu wa asilikari ku Iran wati Israel ikuchita zinthu zowononga dziko lake.
Israel's actions are creating conditions for its own destruction, Irans Revolutionary Guards commander on Friday told a Jerusalem Day rally at which the countrys new domestically-made Kheibar Buster missile was displayed. 	Zochita za Israel zipangitsa kuti dzikoli liwonongeke, mkulu wolamula asillikari ku Iran wanena izi pa msonkhano wa pa tsiku la Yerusalemu pa mwambo woonetsa bomba lomwe dzikolo lapanga lokha, lotchedwa Kheibar Buster
State television said millions of Iranians joined rallies marking Quds Day, the Arabic name for Jerusalem, in state-organized marches across the country. 	Kanema wa boma wati anthu okwana ma miliyoni anapita ku misonkhano ya tsiku la Yerusalemu lomwe ndi Quds Day mu chi Arabic, kukaonera kuguba komwe kunakonzedwa ndi boma m'dzikomo.
"It showed the Israeli flag being set on fire and groups of people around the country shouting choreographed ""Death to America, Death to Israel"" slogans. "	"Kanemayu amawonetsa mbendera ya Israel ikuwotchedwa komanso magulu a anthu m'dzikolo akukuwa mawu olembedwa kuti ""imfa ku America, imfa ku Israel."""
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised speech that anti-Israeli protests and attacks showed that Palestinians rejected compromises by Arab authorities with Israel. 	Poyankhula pa kanema, mtsogoleri Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wati ziwonetsero zodana ndi Israel zikuwonetsa kuti anthu a ku Palestine anakana pempho la akuluakulu a ku Arab kuti amvane ndi Israel.
Opposition to Israel is a touchstone of belief for Iran, which backs Palestinian and Lebanese Islamist militant groups opposed to peace with Israel, which Tehran does not recognize. 	Kutsutsana ndi Israel ndi chimodzi mwa zikhulupiliro za ku Iran, zomwe zimapangitsa kuyikira kumbuyo magulu a zigawenga a ku Palestine ndi ku Lebanon omwe amatsutsana ndi mtendere wa ku Israel, zinthu zomwe mzinda wa Tehran sumazindikira.
"""What has happened in Palestine in recent years annuls all plans for compromise with the Zionist enemy (Israel) because no plan for Palestine can be implemented in the absence or contrary to the opinions of its owners, the Palestinians,"" Khamenei said, speaking in Arabic and addressing Palestinians and other Arabs. "	"""Zomwe zachitika ku Palestine mu zaka zapitazi, zithetsa chikonzero cha mgwirizano ndi adani a Ziyoni (Israel) chifukwa palibe chikonzero cha Palestine chomwe chingatike eni ake palibe kapena ngati pali kuchita zosemphana ndi maganizo a anthu a ku Palestine,"" anatero a Khamenei, kuyankhula chi Arabic ndi anthu a ku Palestine komanso anthu a chi Arab."
"Thus, Khamenei said, all previous peace agreements -- such as the 1993 Oslo Accords, the two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and former U.S. President Donald Trump's plan dubbed the Deal of the Century ""are null and void"". "	A Khamenei ati, mgwirizano wokhazikitsa mtendere womwe unachitika kale--monga Oslo Accords mu 1993 womwe umatanthauza kugawa mayiko a Israel ndi Palestne kuti akhale oyima pawokha pofuna kuthetsa kusamvana komwe kuli pakati pawo komanso chikonzero cha mtsogoreli wakale wa ku U.S a Donald Trump chotchedwa Deal of the Century, tsopano zilibe ntchito.
President Ebrahim Raisi, Irans military commanders and senior officials also attended the rallies in which people were allowed to march through the streets, the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic two years ago. 	Pulezidenti Ebrahim Raisi, akuluakulu a asilikari ku Iran ndi adindo ena anapita nawo ku misonkhanoyi komwe anthu analoledwa kuyenda mmisewu koyamba kuchokera pomwe mliri wa coronavirus unafala, zaka ziwiri zapitazo.
Iran's Jerusalem Day rallies are held annually in support of Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state in territories captured by Israel in a 1967 war, on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. 	Dziko la Iran limachita misonkhano ya tsiku la Yerusalemu chaka chilichonse pofuna kuthandiza anthu a ku Palestine  omwe akufuna kuti kum'mawa kwa Yerusalemu kukhale mzinda wa boma lakutsogolo mzigawo zomwe Israel inatenga pa nkhondo ya 1967, lachisanu lotsiriza la mwezi wosala kudya asilamu wa Ramadan.
"""Stop your vicious deeds. You know well that we are people of action and reaction,"" Revolutionary Guards commander Hossein Salami, addressing Israel, told demonstrators in Tehran. "	"""Siyani kuchita zinthu zankhanza. Mukudziwa bwino kuti ndife anthu ochita komanso obwezera,"" mkulu wa asilikari, HosseinSalami, ananena izi poyankhula ndi Israel komanso kuuza omwe akuchita ziwonetsero ku Tehran."
"""Our responses are painful. You create conditions for your own destruction. We will not leave you alone ...You know better than me what will befall you if you take evil action."" "	"""Mayankho athu ndi opweteka. Mukupanga zinthu zodziwononga nokha. Sitikusiyani..mukudziwa kuposa ine zomwe zitakuchitikireni mukapanga zinthu zoyipa."""
Iran's military has vowed to retaliate harshly against any attack by Israel, which has often voiced concern over the Iranian nuclear program. Tehran says the program is for peaceful purposes only. 	Asilikari a ku Iran alonjeza kubwezera mwaukali ziwawa zilizonse zochoka ku Israel, zomwe zakhudza ndondomeko ya nukiliya ku Iran. Tehran yati ndondomekoyi cholinga chake ndi kubweretsa mtendere basi.
Israel, whose existence the Islamic Republic does not recognize, has long threatened military action against Iran if talks between Tehran and world powers fail to curb Iranian nuclear activity. Iran says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful. 	Dziko la Israel, lomwe kwa boma la asilamu ndi lopanda pake, lakhala likuwopseza kuchita nkhondo ndi dziko la Iran ngati kukambirana pakati pa Tehran ndi mphamvu za dziko lonse kungalephere kuletsa Iran kukonza zinthu za nukiliya. Iran yati zolinga za nukiliya ndi zamtendere.
"In February, the Islamic Republic unveiled its ""Kheibar Buster"" missile with a range of 1,450 km (900 miles). "	"M'mwezi wa Febuluwale, boma la asilamu linabweretsa poyera bomba lawo la ""Kheiber Buster"" lomwe likhoza kuyenda mlengalenga mtunda okwana ma kilomita 1,450 (900 mayilosi)."
Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programs in the Middle East, says its ballistic missiles have a range of up to 2,000 km (1,200 miles) and are capable of reaching its arch-foe Israel and U.S. bases in the region. 	Iran, yomwe ili ndi imodzi mwa ndindomeko zokonzera mabomba ku mayiko aluya, yati mabomba owuluka mlengalengawa akhoza kuyenda mtunda wa makilomita 2000 (1200 mayilosi) ndipo ali ndi kuthekera kokafika komwe kuli adani awo a ku Israel ndi U.S m'chigawochi.
Kheibar refers to an ancient Jewish oasis in the Arabian Peninsula's Hijaz region that was overrun by Muslim warriors in the 7th century. 	Kheibar akutanthauza kasupe wakale wa chi Yuda ku ndomo ya chi Arabian, m'chigawo cha Hijaz yemwe analandidwa ndi asilamu ankhondo mu 7th Century.
Tehran regards its ballistic missile program as an important deterrent against the United States, Israel and other adversaries, and has rejected Western demands to halt it. 	Tehran ikuona kuti ndondomeko yake yokonza mabomba ndi yofunika chifukwa ilepheretsa United States, Israel ndi adani ena ndipo yakana zofuna za mayiko a azungu kuti asiye.
Over the past year, Iran and the United States have engaged in fitful, indirect talks in Vienna to revive a 2015 nuclear deal that then-President Donald Trump reneged on in 2018 and that Iran, in turn, began violating in 2019. 	Mu chaka chatha, Iran ndi United States akhala akukambirana mopanda chindunji komanso mozungulira ku Vienna kuti abwezeretse pangano la nukiliya la mu 2015 lomwe mtsogoleri wa nthawi imeneyo, a Donald Trump anaphwanya ndipo pambuyo pake Iran inachita chimodzimodzi mu 2019.
Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions. 	Pansi pa pangano la 2015, Iran inavomereza kuchepetsa ndondomeko ya nukiliya kusinthanitsa ndi kuchotseredwa chilango pa chuma.
While they appeared close to resurrecting the deal in March, talks stalled over last-minute Russian demands and whether Washington might drop Iran's Revolutionary Guards from its Foreign Terrorist Organization list. 	Pamene amawoneka ngati akuyandikira kubwezeretsa panganoli mu March, zokambiranazi zinayima kaye kamba ka zofuna za Russia komanso ngati Washington ingachotse asilikari a ku Iran pandandanda wa Foreign Terrorist Organization.
As Fewer Americans Attend Church, Can Coffee Shops Fill the Void? 	Pamene anthu a ku America ochepa akupita ku tchalitchi, sitolo zogulitsira khofi zitenga malo?
Churches and other houses of worship have historically played critical social and political functions in American society. But fewer people are attending religious services, and the decline of churches and other houses of worship threatens to leave a void that could potentially be filled by coffee shops.   	Tchalitchi ndi nyumba zopemphelera, kwanthawi tsopano zatengapo gawo pa ubale komanso ndale za anthu a ku America.

"""For so much of American history, the church has really been — or their congregations have really been — essential, providing an unheralded role in providing cohesion and connectedness in communities … encouraging civic engagement and political participation,"" says Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.   "	"""Mu mbiri ya America, tchalitchi - kapena anthu osonkhanawa- akhala ofunikira potenga gawo mwakachetechete pogwira ntchito limodzi komanso kulumikizana m'dera lawo, kulimbikitsa kuthandiza dera komanso kutengapo mbali pa ndale,"" atero a Daniel Cox, mkulu wa Survey Centre on American Life komanso mkulu wa American Enterprise Institute."

Churches and other houses of worship have also played a role in helping immigrants assimilate once they arrive in America, Cox says. 	Tchalitchi ndi nyumba zopemphererako zatenganso udindo pothandiza anthu wobwera kuti akhazikike akafika ku America, atero a Cox.
In 1999, 70% of Americans said they belonged to a church, mosque or synagogue.  	Mu 1999, anthu 70 pa 100 aliwonse ku America anati amapita ku tchalichi, ku mzikiti kapena ku kachisi.
By 2020, that number had dropped to 47%. A 2019 survey found that only about three in 10 Americans say they attend weekly religious services.   	Pofika 2020, nambalayi inatsika kufika pa anthu 47 pa 100 aliwonse. Kafukufuku wa 2019 wapeza kuti anthu atatu pa anthu khumi aliwonse a ku America ndi omwe amapita kopemphera sabata iliyonse.
"Third places  Lack of involvement and affiliation with churches, mosques and synagogues means people might be missing out on what urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg dubbed as ""third places"" — public gathering spots that offer something that home, the ""first place,"" and work, the ""second place,"" might not.   "	"Malo achitatu, kusakhudzidwa ndi kulumikizana ndi ma tchalitchi, mizikiti komanso ma kachisi kukutanthauza kuti anthu akusowekera zomwe katswiri woona za anthu m'matawuni, a Ray Oldenburg, akutchula kuti ""malo achitatu.""- msonkhano omwe umapereka zomwe khomo lomwe ndi ""malo oyamba"" komanso ntchito yomwe ndi ""malo achiwiri"" sizingapereke."
Oldenburg argued that third places are critical to a communitys social vitality.  	A Oldenburg ati malo achitatu amatsutsana ndi maubale komanso umoyo wa anthu m'madera.
An October 2021 survey conducted by the American Survey Center found that commercial spaces like coffee houses foster trust and connection in American communities and could help fill the void left by churches.

"""If you're a regular at a cafe, the barista may know what you usually order, and they can make it for you, and that feels good,"" says clinical psychologist Dr. Maria Espinola, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.

What US Mayors Are Most Worried About After the Pandemic 	Zomwe mafumu a mizinda ku U.S akudandaula ukatha mliri
Americas mayors are most concerned about the lingering mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a nationwide survey of 126 mayors conducted during the summer of 2021.

It is not unusual for large outbreaks of disease to have a negative impact on mental health, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reports that rates of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults increased during the pandemic.

The pandemic has also adversely influenced the emotional and mental health of about one-third of Americas youth. 	Mliriwu wawononganso maganizo ndi thanzi lokhudza maganizo a theka la achinyamata ku America.
"""What we've seen is just such anxiety, kids who wouldn't ordinarily have a meltdown, because it's so much change and difficulty adjusting to transitions,"" Maryland psychologist Mary Karapetian Alvord told VOA last month.

Early on in the pandemic, mayors were more focused on city operations, budget shortfalls and the threat the pandemic posed to small businesses, according to David Glick, an associate professor of political science at Boston University and a co-author of the 2021 Menino Survey of Mayors.

"Over half of mayors, 52%, are worried about ""lingering mental health challenges and trauma,"" according to the survey.

Young Compete Against Old in Hottest US Rental Market in a Decade 	Achinyamata akupikisana ndi akulu pa msika wochita lendi nyumba ku U.S mu zaka khumi
Renting an apartment can be a challenge for new college graduates who are facing the hottest U.S. rental market in a decade, along with some unexpected competition from millennials — people aged 24 to 40 — and even baby boomers — the over-57 club.

"""You have aging millennials who are creating families who should be moving from rental situations into ownership but, because of the lack of housing supply, that has been stopped in a lot of instances.

Renters are feeling the squeeze because the COVID-19 pandemic caused supply chain issues, slowing down home building in the United States. Instead of the usual 5-to-6 month supply of available single-family homes, supply dropped below two months in January 2021. The lack of housing supply means millennials are having a harder time buying a single-family home, which has been the traditional trajectory in the past.

Are COVID-19 Restrictions Stunting Children’s Immune Systems? 	Kodi ziletso za COVID-19 zikuchepetsa kukula kwa chitetezo mmatupi mwa ana?

"""There are a lot of reasons to believe that kids need to be exposed to things to keep their immunity complex, so that should they encounter something very dangerous, they have aspects of their immunity that might cross over and help protect them against those things,"" says Sara Sawyer, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Colorado Boulder.   "	"""Pali zifukwa zambiri zopangitsa kukhulupilira kuti ana amayenera kuyikidwa poyera ku zinthu kuti chitetezo chawo cha mnthupi chilimbe mu njira zosiyanasiyana, kuti akadzakumana ndi zina zoopsa, adzakhale ndi mbali ina ya chitetezo chawo cha mnthupi yomwe idzathandize kuwateteza ku zinthu zimenezi,"" anatero a Sara Sawyer, polofesa tinthu tosaoneka, maselo ndi zinthu zamoyo ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya Colorado Boulder."
At birth, vulnerable infants get antibodies from their mothers breast milk, which helps protect them until they can build their own immunity.

"Its no accident that babies start putting things in their mouths as soon as they gain enough dexterity to pick things up.

Even before the pandemic, epidemiological evidence suggested that children in more developed countries, where handwashing and the use of sanitizer are more prevalent, might have less-developed immune systems compared to kids in developing nations who are routinely exposed to more bacteria, viruses and allergens.

Warren, the father of three young children, says spending lots of time outdoors is one way to balance the negatives of isolation.   	A Warren, omwe ali ndi ana aangono atatu, ati kukhala nthawi yaitali panja ndi njira imodzi yothana ndi zotsatira za kudzipatula.
"""Just exploring microbes in the environment also is benefiting [and] training our immune system,"" Warren says. ""Our immune systems get trained through the foods that we eat, which also have microorganisms on them.

US Quietly Expands Asylum Limits While Preparing to End Them 	Boma la America  laonjezela malire osungira anthu othawa mavuto mu dzikolo pamene likukonzekera kuthetsa kutero.
The Biden administration has begun expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans to Mexico under pandemic-related powers to deny migrants a chance to seek asylum, expanding use of the rule even as it publicly says it has been trying to unwind it, officials said Wednesday. 	Utsogoleri wa a Biden wayamba kusamutsa  anthu a ku Cuba ndi Nicaragua kupita  ku Mexiico potsatira mphamvu zokhudzana ndi  mliri mu njira yowakanizira anthu othawa maiko awo  kukhala mdzikolo, kukulitsa ntchito ya lamulori mmene anafotokozera poyera pamene akuyesera kulithetsa, akukuakulu anatero lachitatu.
The U.S. struck agreement with Mexico to expel up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans a day from three locations: San Diego; El Paso, Texas; and Rio Grande Valley, Texas, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the effort. 	Dziko la United States linapanga mgwirizano ndi dziko la Mexico wotulutsa  anthu makumi khumi a ku Cuba ndi makumi awiri a ku Nicaragua tsiku lilironse kuchokera ku San Diego, El Paso, Texas ndi Rio Grande Valley, malinga ndi mkulu wa dziko la U.S yemwe akudziwa za mchitidwewu.
The expulsions began April 27 and will end May 22, the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the agreement has not been made public.  	Kuthamangitsidwaku, kunayamba pa 27 April ndipo kudzatha pa 22 mwezi wa May. Mkulu wa bomayu  anauza a zofalitsa nkhani kuti iwo asadziwike chifukwa mgwilizanowu siunalengezedwe poyera.
They are carried out under Title 42 authority, a public health law that has been used to expel migrants on grounds of preventing spread of COVID-19. Title 42 is due to expire May 23, unless a judge intervenes. 	Izi zikuchitika pansi pa mutu 42, lamulo la zaumoyo lomwe likugwilitsidwa ntchito kutulutsa anthu osamuka mmaiko awo pazifukwa zopewera kufala kwa matenda a Covid-19' Mutu 42 utha ntchito mu mwezi wa Meyi, pokhapokha  oweruza atalowelera.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed April 26 to a very limited number of expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans, according to a high-level Mexican official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.  	Maiko America ndi Mexico  pa 26 mwezi wa Epulo zothamangitsa anthu owerengeka a ku Cuba ndi Nicaragua, malinga ndi mkulu wogwira ntchito ku Mexico amene anayankhula mobisika chifukwa samaloledwa kupereka ndemanga poyera.
It was prompted by higher numbers of migrants from those two countries coming to the U.S. border. 	Izi zinachitika chifukwa cha kuchuluka kwa anthu osamuka kuchokera ku maiko awiriwa  kubwe ku malire a dziko la America.
Mexico also took into account that the U.S. government had started processing visas in Cuba again, the official said. Mexico had also begun processing visas for Cubans. 	Dziko la Mexico linazindikira kuti boma la America linayambanso kukonza ziphaso zokhalira mdzikolo ku Cuba,  anatero akuluakuluwo. Boma la Mexico linali litayambanso kupangira anthu a ku Cuba ziphaso zokhalira mu dzikomo.
Another Mexican official, also not authorized to comment publicly, confirmed that up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans were being expelled from San Diego under Title 42. 	Mkulu winanso wa boma  wa dziko la Mexico amene sanaloledwenso kupereka ndemanga poyera, anatsimikiza kuti anthu makumi khumi a ku Cuba ndi makumi awiri a ku Nicaragua anathamangitsidwa kuchokera ku San Diego pansi pa mutu 42.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 	Unduna owona za chikhalidwe cha anthu ndi chitetezo  sunaperekepo ndemanga mwachangu monga mwa pempho.
Until last week, Mexico only agreed to take Guatemalans, Hondurans and El Salvadorans — in addition to Mexicans — under Title 42 authority. Other nationalities are subject to Title 42 but costs, strained diplomatic ties and other considerations often make it difficult to send them back to their home countries. 	Kuchokera sabata latha, Boma la Mexico linavomera kutenga anthu a ku Guatemala, Hondura, ndi ku El Salvadora poonjezerapo anthu a ku Mexico pansi pa mutu 42. Maiko enanso ali pansi pa mutuwu koma kamba ka chuma, kupsyinjika kwa mgwirizano wa maiko ndi zifukwa zina ndizomwe zikuvutitsa kuwabweza ku maiko akwao.
It's next to impossible for the U.S. to expel migrants to Cuba or Nicaragua because of poor relations with those governments. That has posed a challenge for the Biden administration as more people from those countries seek haven in the United States. 	Ndizosatheka ku Boma la America kubweza anthu a ku Cuba ndi Nicaragua ku maiko akwawo chifukwa cha ubale osakhala bwino omwe uli pakati pa mabomawa. Izi zinayambita mavuto mu utsogoleri wa a Biden pamene anthu ambiri ochokera mu maikowa amafuna kuti akakhale pabwino ku America ko.
Cubans were stopped by U.S. authorities more than 32,000 times on the Mexican border in March, double the number in February and more than five times October's count, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Nicaragua eased travel restrictions from Cuba in November, making it easier for Cubans to continue by land to the U.S. border. Most enter the U.S. in or near Yuma, Arizona, and Del Rio, Texas. 	anthu a ku Cuba anaimitsidwa ndi akuluakulu a ku America koposera kokwana 32,000 pa malire a dziko la Mexico mu mwezi wa Malichi, kuonjezera nambalayi kawiri mu mwezi wa Febuluwale ndi kuposa kasanu mu chiwerengero cha mwezi wa Okotobala, malinga ndi  a chitetezo ndi oyendetsa katundu pa malire  a dziko la America. Boma la Nicaragua linakhwefula malamulo a mayendedwe kochokera ku Cuba mu mwezi wa Novembala zomwe zinapangitsa anthu a ku Cuba kupitilila ndikukafika ku malire a boma la America. Ambiri mwa iwo amalowa dziko la America kudzera kapena kuyandikila malo a ku Yuma, Arizona ndi ku Del Rio, Texas.
Nicaraguans were stopped more than 16,000 times in March, more than double September's level. The vast majority enter in South Texas. 	Mu mwezi  wa Malichi anthu a ku Nicaragua analetsedwa ndi akuluakulu a ku America koposera ka 16000, kumene kunaposa mwezi wa September kawiri . Ambiri mwaiwo amalowa ku mmwera kwa dera la ku  Texas.
Lifting Title 42 has proved controversial as midterm elections near, even for Biden's Democratic Party, amid concerns that the U.S. is unprepared for an anticipated increase in migrants seeking asylum. Authorities stopped migrants more than 221,000 times in March, the highest mark in 22 years. 	kuchotsa mutu 42 kwakhala kotsutsana pamene pakati pa nthawi yochita masankho yayandikira, ngakhalenso ku Chipani cha mtsogoleri Biden, pakati pa kukhudzidwa kwa boma la America kuti silili lokonzeka kuonjezera chiwerengero cha anthu ofuna kulowa mdziko lawo kufuna pokhala. Akuluakulu aboma analetsa anthu ofuna kulowa mdziko koposera ka 221,000 mu mwezi wa March imene ili nambala yaikulu kuchokera mu zaka makumi awiri ndi ziwiri zapitazo.
The White House and Homeland Security Department have publicly stood behind the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision to end the measure because it could no longer be justified on grounds of protecting public health. 	Nyumba ya chifumu ya ku America ndi unduna woona za chittezo ndi chikhalidwe yaima pambuyo chiganizo cha unduna  ochepetsa ndi kupewa matenda chothetsa lamulo chifukwa silinathenso kuthandizo komanso kuteteza pa za umoyo.
But the practice of expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans runs counter to the administration's public statements that it was phasing out use of the pandemic powers to prepare for May 23. 	Koma mchitidwe wosamutsa  anthu a ku Cuba ndi Nicaragua ukutsutsana ndi ndemanga zomwe atsogoleri  amapereka poyera pothetsa kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka mphamvu za mliri pokonzekera pa 23 mwezi wa Meyi.
The U.S. has expelled migrants more than 1.8 million times under Title 42 authority since March 2020, effectively overriding rights to seek asylum under U.S. law and international treaty. In doing so, migrants are not subject to immigration law, which include rights to seek protection from persecution at home. 	Boma la America lasamutsa anthu 1.8 million olowa mu dzikolo pansi pa mutu  42 kuchokera mu mwezi wa march mu chaka cha 2020, Kupitilira ufulu wofuna pokhala pansi pa lamulo la ku America ndi pangano lapadziko lonse. Potero, anthu osamukasamuka  sakukhudzidwa ndi lamulo losamuka lomwe limakamba za ufulu ofuna kutetezedwa ku kuzunzika kwawo.
The administration said in court filings that it began processing more Central American adults under immigration laws after the CDC's announcement on April 1. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that it couldn't start unwinding Title 42 while it was still in effect. 	Mu zolemba za ku khoti utsogoleriwo unati unayamba kukonza kwambiri mapepala a anthu achikulire a pakati pa dziko la America pansi pa malamulo a kusamuka patatha zolengeza za bungwe la CDC's pa ! Epulo. Koma oweruza milandu sabata yatha analamulira kuti sakanatha kumasula mutu 42 pamene unali ukugwira ntchitobe.
U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays strongly criticized the CDC's decision, suggesting he would try to keep Title 42 in effect after May 23. A hearing is scheduled May 13 for oral arguments. 	Oweluza milandu wa boma la America a Robert Summerhays anadzudzula maganizo a bungwe la CDS pamene anapereka maganizo ot ayesera kuti mutu 42 uzigwilabe ntchito mpakana tsiku la 23 mwezi wa Meyi. Kokamba mulanduwu kudzachitika pa 13 may.
Marisa Limon, senior director of advocacy and planning at the Hope Border Institute, said advocates began learning about expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans from El Paso on Monday and later confirmed the new practice with U.S. officials. 	A Marisa Limon, mkulu woyang'anila kulimbikitsa ndi kukonzekera ku Bungwe lotchedwa, Hope Border Institute , anati olimbikitsawa anayamba kudziwa za kusamutsidwa kwa anthu a ku Cuba ndi ku Nicaragua kuchokera kwa El Paso lolemba ndipo anatsimikiza mchitidwe watsopanowu ndi akuluakulu a boma la America.
"Limon said the administration is ""trying to get every last bit out of Title 42"" before it expires. She called it ""sobering"" but consistent with the administration's efforts to have other countries in the Western hemisphere take more responsibility for hosting people fleeing their homes. "	A Limon anati  utsogoleri wawo ukuyesetsa kudziwa mapeto onse a mutu 42 usanasiye kugwira ntchito. Iwo anaufotokoza kuti ndi wanzeru koma pakuyenera kuti atsogoleri aziikilako khama kuti maiko ena a kumadzulo kwa dziko lapansi akhalenso ndi udindo wosunga anthu othawa kwawo.
Mexico Relocates Migrant Camp; Haitians Appear at Border 	Boma la Mexico lasamutsa misasa ya anthu osamukira mu dzikolo; anthu aku  Haiti aonekera pa malire a dziko.
Mexican authorities said Tuesday they have relocated a migrant camp that sprung up in a park in the border city of Reynosa, moving about 2,000 people from Central America and Haiti to a shelter in the city, across the border from McAllen, Texas. 	Akuluakulu a boma la Mexico lachiwiri amati asamutsa msasa wa  anthu olowa mu dzikolo omwe unatulukira ku ndime  mu mzinda wa malirewo wa  Reynosa,  asuntha pafupifupi anthu mazana awiri kuchoka pakati pa Boma la america ndi Haiti kupita ku malo  ena owasungilako  kuolokera ku malire ochokera ku McAllen Texas.
The camp of migrants mainly from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti sprung up after U.S. officials, citing the pandemic, invoked a health rule that denies migrants a chance to seek asylum. 	Malo okhala anthu osamukila dzikolo makamaka ochokera ku dziko la Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras ndi ku Haiti kunachuluka anthu pamene akuluakulu a boma la America  anabweretsa lamulo la zaumoyo loletsa anthu osamukira mu dzikolo kupeza mwayi wopatsidwa chitetezo chifukwa cha mliri.
Mexico's National Immigration Institute said the migrants were taken around midnight Monday to the shelter, which it said will have better hygiene and food services. 	Bungwe loona zolowa ndi kutuluka kwa anthu mu dziko la Mexico lotchedwa ( Mexico's Immigration Institute linati  anthuwo anatengedwa lolemba pakati pa usiku kupita ku malo owasungilawo amene akuyenera kukhala a ukhondo komanso chakudya chabwino.
But on Monday, people in another border city, Nuevo Laredo, said hundreds of migrants, mainly Haitians, have streamed into that city, which is across the border from Laredo, Texas 	Lolemba lomwelo anthu ochokera ku malire a dziko a ku Nuevo Laredo anafotokoza kuti anthu opitilira makumi khumi makamaka a dziko la Haiti anakhamikira mu mzindawo umene uli mbali yoyang'anana ndi malire a dzikolo kochokera ku Laredo, Texas
The rush apparently started after the U.S. began processing some asylum-seekers there. 	Kukhamikilako kunayamba pamene boma la America linayamba ndondomeko yopereka chitetezo kwa anthu othawira mu dzikolo.
The Catholic bishop of Nuevo Laredo said Monday that migrant shelters there are overcrowded, with some migrants sleeping outside in tents. 	Mkulu wa mpingo wa katolika wa ku Nuevo, lolemba apati malo okhalako anthu osamukila mu dzikolo  ndi othinana pamene anthu ena akugona panja pa misanja.
Bishop Enrique Sánchez Martínez said migrants started streaming into Nuevo Laredo in late April, though the city isn't usually popular among migrants, in part because it is dominated by the violent Northeast drug cartel. 	A Bishopu Enrique Sanchez Martínez anati anthuwa anayamba kulowera ku Nuevo Laredo ku mapeto kwa mwezi wa Epulo, ngakhale mzindawo sudziwika kwambiri ndi anthu ochokera maiko ena, chifukwa unadzadzidwa ndi zigawenga za ku Northeast drug carte
"""It is new for us because this is the last place they come, due to the conditions of our border, of our city, which are sometimes adverse for migrants,"" the bishop said. ""But since they opened the door in the United States to asylum requests, a lot of them came in large groups."" "	‘Izi ndi zachilendo kwa ife chifukwa awa ndi malo omalizira amene iwo sangabwereko, chifukwa cha mkhalidwe wa  malire dziko lathu, mu mzinda wathu umene umatsutsana ndi anthu osamukila mu dzikoli” anatero mkulu wansembeyo. Koma chifukwa a Boma la America linatsekula khomo lopereka chitetezo ndi malo kwa anthu othawira mdzikolo, ambiri mwaiwo anabwera mwa unyinji.
Marvin Ajic, the director of the Casa Nazareth shelter, said that around April 16, Mexican authorities notified the shelters that the United States would resume processing asylum claims for humanitarian reasons. 	A Marvin Ajic, mkulu wa malo osungira anthu a ku Casa Nazareth anati pa 16 Epulo, akuluakulu a boma la Mexico anadziwitsa anthu a ku malo osungidwawo kuti boma a America liyamba  ndondomeko yothandiza anthu othawira dzikolo pa zifukwa zothandizila anthu.
The U.S. had begun allowing more people in, especially Central American adults, to prepare for lifting Title 42 — a pandemic-era health rule that denies migrants a chance to enter the U.S. seek asylum — on May 23. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that the government could not unwind the rule before the end date. 	Boma la America linali litayamba kulowetsa anthu mdzikolo makamaka akuluakulu a pakati pa dziko la America pokonzekera kuchotsa mutu 42, lamulo la nthawi ya mliri limene limakaniza anthu kusamukira mdziko la America kufuna chitetezo. Pa 23 Meyi, oweruza milandu wa ku Louisiana sabata yatha analamula kuti boma silingathetse lamulolo tsiku lane lisanakwane.
"""The (Mexican) immigration officials organized things with the shelters, and the plan was to send people who had been waiting a long time, without any checks, basically anyone,"" Ajic said. "	Akuluakulu oona zolowa ndi kutuluka mdziko la Mexico anakonza zinthu ndi malo osungilako anthuwo,  ndondomeko yawo inali yotumiza  kwawo anthu omwe amadikilira kwa nthawi yaitali opanda kusechedwa makamaka aliyense, anatero a Ajic.
That apparently drew the attention of other migrants, including Haitians. 	Izi zinakoka mitima ya anthu ena ofuna kulowa mdzikolo kuonjezerapo achokera ku Haiti.
In September, similar rumors sparked a rush by about 15,000 mostly Haitian refugees to the Texas border, where they camped under a bridge. U.S. officials began large scale deportations of Haitians while also allowing thousands to remain in the U.S. 	Mwezi wa september, phekesera ngati zomwezi zinachititsa anthu othawa nwawo okwana  15,000 a ku Haiti kupita ku malire a dzikolo a  ku Texas kumene anamangako misanja pansi pa mlatho. Akuluakulu a boma la America anayamba kubweza  kwawo gulu la anthu a ku Haiti pamene ena  mazana mazana analoledwa kukhala mu dziko la America lo.
Ajic warned migrants against coming to the border, noting the risks. On Monday, Mexico's National Immigration Institute said that so far this year, it has pulled the bodies of 19 immigrants from the Rio Grande, also known as the Rio Bravo. 	Ajic anachenjeza anthu ofuna kusamukira mu dzikolo kudzera ku malire a dziko la America poona zoopsa zake. Lolemba, oona za kulowa ndi kutuluka mdziko la Mexico anati chaka chino, achotsa matupi a anthu khumi ndi asanu ndi anayi kuchokera ku Rio Grande komwenso kumadziwika kuti Rio Bravo.
New US Rule Grants Automatic Work Permit Extensions to Noncitizens 	lamulo latsopano la ku America likupereka nthawi yoonjezera ziphaso zogwilira ntchito mu dzikomo kwa anthu amene ndi ochokera maiko ena payokha.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced Tuesday that it would automatically extend for 360 days the work permits of immigrants who applied to renew their work authorization amid the current backlog in processing times. 	Ogwira ntchito yöpereka ziphaso ndi oona zolowa ndi kutuluka mdzikomp lachiwiri analengeza kuti aonjezera pawokha masiku 360 ololeza anthu osamukira mdzikolo kugwirabe ntchito  kamba ka kuchedwa kulongosola mapepala komwe kukuchitika.
The new notice expands on the 180-day extension USCIS announced in November. It is expected to prevent about 260,000 immigrants from losing their work permits in the next 18 months. It will also give the agency extra time to clear applicants waiting in line, the agency said in a statement. 	Chidziwitso chatsopanochi  chaonjezera pa masiku 180  amene a bungwe USCIS analengeza mu mwezi wa Novembala. Izi zikuyembekezeka kupewetsa anthu osamukira mdzikolo okwana 260,000 kutaya ziphaso zawo zogwilira ntchito mdzikolo kwa miyezi 18 yomwe ikubwerayi. Izinso zipereka nthawi yokwanira ku nthambiyo kuti ilongosole ndandanda wa anthu omwe akudikilira kuthandizidwa, nthambiyo inatero.
"""This temporary rule will provide those noncitizens otherwise eligible for the automatic extension an opportunity to maintain employment and provide critical support for their families while avoiding further disruption for U.S. employers,"" USCIS Director Ur M. Jaddou said in a statement. "	Mu kufotokoza kwawo bwana wa bungwe la  USCIS a Ur M. Haddou anati lamulo lakanthawi kochepali lipereka mwayi kwa anthu emene sali mnzika za  mdzikolo kuti akhalebe akugwira ntchito mdzikolo kuti azithandizabe mabanja awo pamene akupewa kusokoneza ogwira ntchito a boma la America
The extension, which takes effect Wednesday, aims to stabilize operations for U.S. employers and help people with pending employment authorizations who have a job and are working in the U.S. 	Kuonjezera nthawi ku komwe kuyambe kugwira ntchito lachitatu, kukhazikitsa  kagwiridwe ntchito ka anthu  a boma la America komanso kuthandiza anthu a ku  America amene ndi ovomelezeka  kugwira ntchito mu dzikolo komanso ali pa ndandanda wodikilira kulembedwa ntchito.
USCIS is the agency in charge of handling the nation's immigration paperwork. In recent years, it has struggled with backlogs, an issue made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic and budget shortfalls. 	USCIS ndi nthambi yomwe imayang’anira mapepala onse a anthu olowa ndi kutuluka mdzikomo. zaka zapitazo nthambiyi yakhala ikubwelera mmbuyo, mliri wa covid-19 ndi vuto la ndondomeko zachuma ndikomwe kunaonjezera kubwelera mmbuyoku.
In April, Jaddou told U.S. government officials during a congressional hearing that USCIS had 8.5 million pending immigration cases, including those seeking green cards and U.S. naturalization. 	Mwezi wa epulo a Jaddou anauza boma la America ku msonkhano wawo kuti a USCIS anali ndi milanduyodikila kuweruzidwa yokwana 8.5 million, kuonjezerapo ya anthu ofuna kupeza chiphaso chokhalira mdzikomo cha green card, ndi ena ofuna kutsimikiza kuti anabadwira mdzikomo.
She said more than half of those pending cases were taking longer than the agency's normal processing times. 	Iwo anati kupitilira theka la milanduyi yodikira kuzengedwayi  inatenga nthawi yaitali  nthawi yomwe nthambiyi imagwira nthawi zonse.
Asylum-seekers, immigrants adjusting their status to permanent residence and other noncitizens going through the U.S. immigration process are among the noncitizens affected by the latest work authorization extension. 	Anthu othawa mavuto mmaiko awo , osamuka maiko akwawo ofuna kukhazikika mdziko la America ndi ena amene si mzika za dzikolo ndi amene akhudzidwa ndi ndondomeko yoonjezera nthawi yogwira ntchito mdzikoli.
The agency had reported that processing times for asylum applicants looking to renew work permits increased from seven months in 2017 to 11 months in 2021. 	Nthambiyi inafotokoza kuti inaonjezera nthawi kwa anthu othawa maiko akwawo kamba ka mavuto  kuchoka pa miyezi isanu ndi iwiri mu Chaka cha 2017 kufika pa miyezi khumi ndi umodzi mu Chaka cha 2021.
In March, USCIS announced a program to reduce backlogs, including the expansion of premium processing for certain applications where applicants could pay a higher fee to expedite paperwork processing. 	Mu mwezi wa M alichi, a USCIS analengeza dongosolo lochepetsa kubwelera mmbuyo, kuonjezelaponso kakonzedwe kapamwamba ka  mapepala komwe anthu  ena atha kulipira mtengo wokwelerapo pofulumizitsa njira yokonza ziphaso zawo
According to the USCIS, most of the announced changes simply restore options offered before the Trump administration's slowdown of USCIS processing and before the COVID-19 pandemic further slowed the agency's resources.

"""For several years, USCIS has been in a precarious financial situation that has impaired the efficient completion of caseloads. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these challenges in 2020, in addition to a hiring freeze and furlough threat leading to workforce attrition and severely reduced capacity.

Report: Rwanda Should Ease Restrictions On 2003 National Elections - 2001-10-15 	Lipoti:  Dziko la Rwanda likuyenera kukhwepetsa malamulo mu chaka cha 2003 a zisankho za dzikolo, 2001-10-15
In 2003 Rwanda will hold its first national elections since the 1994 genocide. A new report says the government of Rwanda needs to relax its control over public life if the polls are to have any credibility. 	 Dziko la Rwanda  lipangitsa zisankho za dzikolo koyamba patatha kuphedwa kwa anthu kwa chipulula komwe kunachitika mu Chaka cha 1994. Lipoti latsopano lati kuti dziko la Rwanda likuyenera kuchepetsa mphavu zolamulira anthu ndi cholinga choti zisankhozi zikhale zodalirika.
There was relief when the Rwandan Patriotic Front seized power in Rwanda in 1994, ending the genocide in which about 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. 	Anthu anapepukidwa pamene chipani cha Patriotic Front chinatenga boma mu Chaka cha 1994, kuthetsa kupha kwa anthu mwaunyinji komwe kunapha ana ochepa okwana 800,000 a mtundu wa Tutsis ndi Hutus.
The new military government promised to restore democracy to Rwanda via elections in 2003. 	Boma lastopano la asilikali linalonjeza kubwezeletsa ufulu wa ndale mu dziko la Rwanda kudzera mu zisankho za chaka cha 2003.
That process began in March this year, with district elections. 	Ndondomeyi inayamba mwezi wa Malichi chaka chino ndi zisankho za mmaboma.
Senior analyst Francois Grignon, of the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based policy research organization, says he was disappointed with the district poll. Mr. Grignon says the process was so tightly controlled that he maintains no genuine opposition candidates were allowed to stand. 	Katswiri wamkulu wa bungwe lotchedwa  International Crisis group; a Francois Grignon, bungwe lakafukufuku la ku Brussels , anati ndiwokhumudwa ndi mmene zisankho zinayendera maboma. Mr Grignon anati mavotedwewa analamuliridwa kwambiri ndipo panalibe anthu otsutsa boma amene analoledwa kuimila nawo maudindowo.
"""There was a screening and there was a preparation of the elections, which did not allow other candidates than those who had been rubber-stamped by the government to actually contest, especially for the executive positions within the local authorities,"" he says. ""If consensual democracy means that the political debate is actually handled before the electoral contest in such a way that it does not lead to a real competition then there is no democracy at all."" "	“Panali kafukufuku komanso kukonzekera zisankhozo kumene sikunalole anthu ena omwe samaimila boma kupikisana nawo, makamaka oimila maudindo akuluakulu mu madera ang’onoang’ono.” Iwo anatero. “Ngati ufulu waaliyense ukutanthauza kuti kutsutsana pa ndale  kuchitika mpikisano wa zisankho usanachitike, mpaka kulepheretsa kuchitanso zisankho zenizeni, ndekuti palibe ufulu uliwonse.
In a new report, titled Consensual Democracy in Post Genocide Rwanda, the International Crisis Group urges the international community to pressure Rwanda's government to liberalize political activity. 	Mu lipoti latsopano lotchedwa Consensual Democracy in Post Genocide Rwanda, gulu lapadziko lonse loona za mavuto lapempha gulu la pa dziko lonse kuti likakamize boma la Rwanda kukhazikitsa ufulu wa ndale.
The report notes that the military dominates public life and there is little open criticism of the government, either in the media or by opposition figures. The Rwanda government argues that allowing a range of opinions would be dangerous in a country struggling to come to terms with its bloody past. 	Lipotilo lapezanso kuti asilikali ndiomwe akulamulira  anthu komanso kunyoza boma, kudzera mu nyumba zofalitsa mawu kapena otsutsa boma. Boma la Rwanda latsutsa kuvomera maganizo  a anthu osiyanasiyana chifukwa izi zitha kukhala zoopsa ku dziko lomwe likufuna kukhazikika kutengera ndi kale lake loipa.
But Mr. Grignon says dissent is simply being driven underground or outside Rwanda's borders. 	Mr Grignon anati kutsutsaku  kukumachitika mwachinsinsi kapena  kunja kwa malire a dziko la Rwanda.
"""Opponents to the regime have to flee the country or to join in rebel movements outside the country or in the Congo and no chance to express a different view,"" he says. ""All the good policies that the government has been implementing - including the organization of the elections, national elections, presidential and parliamentary, in 2003 - will lack the credibility because they were not implemented in an environment that actually allowed a fair contest to take place,"" he says. "	“Anthu otsutsa boma amathawa dzikolo kapena kulowa nawo mmagulu oukila boma kunja kwa dzikolo kapena ku dziko la Congo komwe alibe mwayi wopereka maganizo ena”, iwo anatero. “Malamulo onse abwino amene boma lakhala likukhazikitsa- kuonjezerapo kulongosola zisankho, zisankho za maiko, za mtsogoleri komanso aphungu mu Chaka cha 2003- zidzasowa chilungamo chifukwa sizinakhazitsidwe pa malo ololela kupikisana kwachilungamo, iwo anatero.
Mr. Grignon says greater freedom of expression would strengthen Rwanda's reconciliation process and enhance its chances of a peaceful future. 	Mr. Grignon  anati ufulu womasuka utha kulimbikitsa  njira yobwelera mchimake ku dziko la Rwanda komanso kuojezera mphamvu zodzetsa tsogolo la mtendere  mdzikolo.
He says the international community's involvement in reconstruction projects gives it the leverage to make this plain to the Rwandan government. 	Iwo anati kulowelera kwa gulu lapadziko lonse mu ntchito yomanga yomwe ikuchitika, kupeleka phindu ku dziko la Rwanda.

The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, is pushing for child soldiers to be demobilized in Africa's Great Lakes region, as several peace drives there build momentum. The agency says funding is in place to help the children leave the military and restart their lives. 	Nthambi yoona za ana ya United nations, UNICEF, likulimbikitsa kuti ana achichepere achisilikali achotsedwe ku dera la Great lakes ku Afilika, pamene mtendere ochuluka umabweretsa mphamvu. Nthambiyi inati pali chithandizo cha chuma chomwe chithandizire anawa kusiya usilikari ndi kukayambiranso moyo wawo.
"UNICEF's top child protection official, Manuel Fontaine, says peace initiatives in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are making it possible to get more children under the age of 18 out of fighting units. ""We insist that child soldiers could be demobilized, even in conflict situations. We should never wait for peace to get children out of any form of armed group. But, obviously, that's a better timing at the moment. It's more conducive to demobilization,"" Mr. Fontaine said. "	"Mkulu woona za chitetezo cha ana ku bungwe la UNICEF, a Manuel Fontaine, anati njira zobweretsa mtendere ku Uganda, Congo ndi Rwanda zikupangitsa kuthekera kowachotsa ana ochepera zaka 18 mu malo omenyera nkhondo.

He says there are currently 1,200 child soldiers in Uganda, fighting mainly with the rebel Lord's Resistance Army. He says that over the past 14 years, the group has abducted some 10,000 children, boys to fight and girls to serve as sex slaves. 	Iwo anati pakadali pano ana 1200 achisilikali ali ku Uganda kumenyana ndi gulu loukila la Lords Resistance. Ndipo anati kupitilira zaka 14 zapitazo gululi linagwira ana 10,000, anyamata okamenya nkhondo, atsikana okagona nawo mwaukapolo ndi mokakamiza.

Kuchokera ku UNICEF, dziko la Congo lidakali ndi ana okwanira 10,000 omwe anatengedwa kukamenya nkhondo, pamene dziko la Rwanda lili ndi ana 2000 omenya nawonso nkhondo
UNICEF says, even though some of the children do not directly engage in fighting, they are exposed to many dangers. They may be used as porters, carrying very heavy loads, or as messengers or spies passing information and scouting out enemy territory. 	Bungwe la UNICEF linati ngakhale ana ena sakhudzidwa ndi kumenya nkhondo, amaonetsedwa zinthu zoopsa zambiri. Ena amagwiritsidwa ntchito ngati alonda, onyamula katundu wolemera kwambiri, otumidwa kapena a kazitape okatenga nkhani ku malo a adani awo.

UNICEF's Manuel Fontaine says demobilization takes time and money. He says the children must first be found, and then removed from their government or rebel units. Then, resources are needed to help them rebuild their lives. That involves providing schools, vocational training and health care.

Activists Press for Better Help to End Congo Rapes 	Anthu omenyera ufulu apempha chithandizo chothetsera mchitidwe wogwililira mu dziko la Congo.
As U.N. Special Representative for Sexual Violence In Conflict Margot Wallstrom embarks on a new trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, two activists recently concluded lobbying efforts in the United States for more effective action on trying to end conflict-related rapes in Congo.

One of them, Justine Masika Bihamba, told a gathering of Washington, D.C., university students and concerned citizens that the area in which she works, Beni, in North Kivu province, is still overrun by Ugandan rebels who regularly rape women.She said in these situations women are considered victims, and are not implicated in the search for peace. 	A Justine Masika Bihamba anauza msonkhano ku Washington, D.C, ophunzira a sukulu ya ukachenjede ndi nzika zokhudzidwa kuti komwe amagwira ntchito iwo ku dera la North Kivu province, lidakalamuliridwabe ndi oukila boma amene amakhalira kugwililira azimayi pafupipafupi.

Bihamba coordinates an organization called the Synergy of Women Against Sexual Violence.  	"A Bihamba  achita umodzi ndi bungwe lotchedwa  ""mgwirizano wa azimayi pothetsa nkhanza zogonana."
Counselors with the group have been attacked and threatened because of their work. When Bihamba was at work one day, Congolese soldiers attacked her home, and sexually assaulted one of her daughters.  	Alangizi a gululi aopsezedwa chifukwa cha ntchito yawo. A Bihamba ali ku ntchito tsiku lina, asilikali a ku Congo analowa mnyumba mwawo mopanda chilolezo  ndikugwililira mmodzi mwa ana awo.
Bihamba explained that what is needed - above all - is peace in eastern Congo.  	A Bihamba anafotokoza kuti chomwe chikufunika pazonse mu dziko la Congo ndi mtendere.
She said she believes sexual crimes would go down drastically if fighting stopped.  	Iwo anati akukhulupilira kuti milandu yokhudza mchitidwe wogwililirawu itha kutheratu kumenyana kukasiya.
Activist Donatella Rostagno, from the European network for Central Africa, accompanied Bihamba on her trip to the United States.  	A  Donatella Rostagno omenyera ufula ochokera ku Europian network ya pakati pa Afilika, anawaperekeza a Bihamba pa ulendo wawo wa ku America.
She said she supports the work being done by the U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict.  	Iwo anati ali pambuyo pa ntchito imene akugwira woimira bungwe la UN yothetsa nkhanza ndi nkhanza zogonana.
Rostagno also said feels, however, the international community is not doing enough to stop Congo's war, despite having a large U.N. peacekeeping mission there.  	A Rostagno anati iwe akuona ngati gulu la dziko lonse sili kuchitapo ntchito yokwanira kuthetsa nkhondo ya dziko la Congo ngakhale kuli gulu la asilikali oobweretsa mtendere kudzikolo.
"""The majority of the actions is made to look at the consequences, to work with the women who are victims, but not enough is done to look at the causes of the rapes and the conflict,"" said Rostagno. "	"""Zotsatira za mchitidwewu ndizomwe ambiri akuona, kugwira ntchito ndi azimayi ozunzidwa, koma palibe chokwanira chomwe akuchita kuti aone zomwe zikuchititsa mchitidwe wogwililira komanso mikangano,"" anatero a Rostagno."

"""A lot of these rebel groups are getting reorganized, and are even getting in a coalition so the movements that we see in the region, it is worrying us,"" said Rostagno.  "	"""Ambiri mwa anthu oukilawa ayamba akupanganso magulu ndi kukumananso, zomwe zikutidandaulitsa kwambiri mmadera,"" anatero a Rostagno."

Rostagno explained that foreign non-governmental organizations get funding to tackle the issue of sexual violence, but local organizations often get ignored.  	A Rostagno anafotokoza kuti mabungwe amene siaboma amapeza  thandizo la ndalama zogwilira ntchito pa  nkhani ya nkhanza zogonana, pamene mabungwe aboma amaiwalidwa.
She said complex applications to get outside funding favor bigger organizations.  	Iwo anati  makalata opempha thandizo lovutika  amakonderedwa ndi mabungwe akuluakulu okha.
"""They can just do it, they send it, they receive the money.  "	"""Atha kungopanga,  amatumiza, amalandira ndalama."
"The problem is that the money in most cases is spent to pay for the fixed cost of the organization, for the salaries of expat people coming to the region and to the country, while the local non-governmental organizations, those working with the communities, with the women, with the children, in the villages, those who need need money to survive in order to do their work do not have access,"" said Rostagno.Bihamba said Congolese soldiers should be paid directly through bank withdrawals, rather than being paid through their superiors.  "	"Vuto lake ndilakuti nthawi zambiri ndalamayo imagwiritsidwa kulipira mitengo yazinthu  yokhazikika ya bungwelo, malipirp a akatswiri obwera ku delaro ndi ku dzikolo, pamene mabungwe oti siaboma, amene amagwira ntchito mmadera ndi azimayi, ndi ana mmidzi, amene amafuna ndalama kuti akhale ndi moyo mmalo mogwira ntchito saloledwa,"" anatero a Rostagno. A Bihamba anati asilikari a ku Congo akuyenera kulipiridwa kudzera ku banki osati kupatsidwa ndi mabwana awo."
Bihamba said with the current system they receive only about a third of their salary, which causes some soldiers to loot and rape.  	   A Bihamba anati njira yomwe ilipoyi asilikali akumalandira malipiro osakwana zomwe zikupangitsa kuti aziba komanso kugwililira.
She also called for an international tribunal for the Congo to help end general impunity, as well as more local tribunals for raped victims to seek justice. In North Kivu, where more than 5 million people are estimated to live, she said there are only three tribunals. 	Iwo anaitanitsa khoti ladziko lonse kuti lithandize njira yosalanga anthu olakwa, komanso makhoti okhudza anthu ogwililidwa omwe akufuna chilungamo chioneke. Ku dera la North Kivu kuli anthu oposera 5 million koma kuli malo ozengera milandu atatu okha.

Economists Predict Bumpy Road for Malawi's Economy in 2015 	Olondoloza  zachuma aneneratu kuti chuma cha dziko la Malawi chitha osayenda bwino mu chaka cha 2015.
Economists in Malawi say the country is likely to continue facing financial challenges in 2015 unless the government can regain the confidence of donors, who are still withholding 40 percent of budgetary support due to the corruption scandal known as Cashgate. More than $30 million were looted from government coffers in the scandal, and several people, including government officials, were arrested. 	Olondoloza chuma mu dziko la Malawi afotokoza kuti dziko lino litha kupitilira kukumana ndi mavuto a zachuma pokhapokha anthu othandiza ataloweleleraponso, anthu othandizawa sanapereke mbali ya chithandizo cha ndalama yogwiritsira ntchito ku boma chokwanira gawo la 40% kamba ka mchitidwe wa katangale wotchedwa cashgate. Ndalama zopitilira 30 million dollars ndi zomwe zinabedwa kuboma. Anthu ambiri  kuphatikizapo ogwira ntchito m'boma anamangidwa.
The withholding of donor aid has forced Malawi's government to pass what is known as the Zero Aid national budget for the 2014-2015 fiscal year. Analysts, such as Abel Mwanyungwe, an economics lecturer at the Polytechnic College of the University of Malawi, say the drop in spending has hurt the economy. 	Kuimitsidwa kwa chithandizo chochokera maiko ena kwakakamiza dziko la malawi kudutsitsa madongosolo a ndalama  a chaka cha 2014-2015 otchedwa Zero Aid national budget. A  Abel Mwanyungwe mmodzi ounguza komanso mphunzitsi wa ndondomeko za chuma ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya Polytechnic College anati kutsika kwa kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka ndalama  kwasokoneza ndondomeko ya chuma.
"""This has been a bumpy year as we are coming from the Cashgate effects that have quite a major dent on the economys performance. We have seen that in most cases the very delicate and crucial departments and service providers have been affected, in the sense that we dont have enough drugs in the hospitals. In schools, in terms of teachers payments is not in time,"" said Mwanyungwe. "	"""Chaka chino chakhala chovuta kwambiri pamene tikuchokera kuzotsatira za Cashgate zimene zaononga kayendetsedwe ka chuma. Malo antchito ambiri komanso anthu obweretsa katundu mdzikoli akhudzidwa monga tilibe mankhwala mzipatala, komanso malipiro a aphunzitsi sakumafika mu nthawi yake, anatero a mwanyungwe."
Mwanyungwe also links Cashgate to the recent depreciation of Malawis currency, the kwacha, which has resulted in strikes by various government workers demanding higher pay. 	A Manyungwe analumikizanso kutsika kwa ndalama ya Malawi ndi kubedwa kwa ndalama mosakadza komwe kunachitika, zomwe zachititsa zionetsero kuchokera kwa  anthu osiyanasiyana ogwira ntchito m'boma pomwe akufuna kukwezedwa malipiro awo.
For example, support staff for the judiciary have been on strike for six weeks, seeking a 45 percent pay increase which the government says it cannot afford because it has no money. 	Mwachitsanzo anthu othandizira ntchito ku khoti akhala akunyanyala ntchito kwa masabata asanu ndi imodzi pofuna kuti malipiro awo akwezedwe kufika pa 45% zomwe aboma akuti sangakwanitse kutero  chifukwa alibe ndalama.
Workers at Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau went on strike demanding a 70 percent pay raise until the government threatened to forfeit their December salaries if they did not return. 	Ogwira ntchito a ku bungwe lothana ndi ziphuphu ananyanyala ntchito pofuna kuti malipiro awo akwezedwe kufika pa 70%  koma a boma anawaopseza kuti salandira malipiro awo a mwezi wa Disembala ngati sabwelera kunchito.
Mwanyungwe said the government can only avoid further strikes in 2015 if it makes efforts to restore donor confidence in the management of its public finances. 	A Manyungwe anati boma litha kupewa kunyanyala ntchito kwinanso mu chaka cha 2015 ngati lingayesetse  kubwezeretsa chikhulupiliro cha anthu othandiza boma pa kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka ndalama za dziko.
"""My fear is that if we dont have this donor confidence and donor support coming back to the economy, we may force the government to go into serious local borrowing that would lead to serious repercussions in terms of inflation, in terms of interest rates and this may have a sort of catch-catch lose situation,"" said Mwanyungwe. "	Chomwe ndikuopa ndichakuti ngati athu otithandiza sangatikhulupilirenso, ndikukhalanso opanda chithandizo ku ndondomeko ya chuma chathu, boma litha kukakamizidwa kukabwerekanso ndalama mudziko mommuno zomwe zingadzetse mavuto monga kukwera kwa zinthu, kudzera mu ndalama yaapamwamba yoperekedwa pobweza ndalama. Iyi ndi nyengo yapakatikati, anatero a Manyungwe.
The donors are, among other things, demanding that the government prosecute all those involved in the scandal and strengthen its financial management system. 	Mwa zina zomwe anthu othandizawa akufuna dziko lichite ndi kumanga anthu onse amene anakhudzidwa ndi kuba ndalamazo ndicholinga cholimbitsa njira ya  kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka ndalama.
"Newton Kambala, the president of the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the scandal rendered 2014 as ""a very bad year for the business sector, because of huge debts that the government owes the private sector."" "	Mtsogoleri wa bungwe la Malawi Confederation of Chambers of commerce and Industry a Newton kambala, anati kuba ndalama komwe kunachitika mu chaka cha 2014 kunaipitsa nthambi ya anthu ochita malonda chifukwa cha ngongole zochuluka zomwe boma linali nazo kwa anthu a malondawa.
"He warned that if the situation persists, ""2015 will be worse."" "	Iwo anachenjeza kuti ngati zipitilire chonchi, chaka cha 2015 chidzaipa kuposera pano.
In his state of the nation address last Saturday, Malawi president Peter Mutharika said his government is doing everything possible to address the problems caused by the Cashgate scandal. 	Mtsogoleri wa dziko lino a Peter Mutharika pamene amalankhula ku  mtundu wa a  Malawi loweruka lapitali, anati boma lawo likuyesetsa kuchita mothekera kukonza mavuto amene anadza ndi kuba ndalama.
"""My government has strengthened the financial system to make sure that Cashgate never occurs again in Malawi. We have resourced fairly well the law enforcement institutions, including the Anti-Corruption Bureau, so that they do a thorough independent job, prosecute all suspects, and recover the stolen resources where possible,"" said Mutharika. "	"Boma langa lakhwimitsa malamulo ku nthambi ya zachuma oonetsetsa kuti kuba ndalama mosakadza kusadzachitikenso mu dziko la Malawi.

Malawi to Conduct Door-to-Door HIV Testing 	Dziko la Malawi liyamba kuyeza matenda a edzi khomo ndi khomo.
Malawians have mixed reactions to government plans to introduce door-to door HIV testing early next year. Supporters say the step is urgently needed because 100 Malawians get infected each day, and an average of 138 die from AIDS daily. Minister of Health Jean Kalirani announced the plans during the recent commemoration of World AIDS Day in the northern district of Karonga. 	Amalawi  ali ndi maganizo osiyanasiyana pamene boma likukonzekera kuyambitsa kuyeza matenda a edzi khomo ndi khomo kumayambiliro kwa chaka cha mawa. Omwe ali pa mbuyo pa maganizowa akuti njirayi ikufunika kwambiri chifukwa tsiku lilironse amalawi 100 amatenga matendawa ndipo anthu osachepera 138 amamwalira tsiku lilironse ndi matenda a Edzi. nduna ya zaumoyo a Jean Kalirani analengeza ndondomekoyi pa tsiku lokumbukira matenda a Edzi mu boma la Karonga.
"""We will go in the villages asking for blood samples to check whether that person is HIV positive or not. And those that will be found HIV positive will definitely be given the care they need. And those who are found negative will also be counseled so that they remain negative,"" said Kalirani. "	Tizipita mmidzi kukatenga magazi kwa anthu pofuna kudziwa ngati ali ndi kachiromboko kapena ayi. Amene azipezeka ndi matendawo azipatsidwa chisamaliro choyenera. Ndipo amene alibe azipatsidwa malangizo a mmene angakhalire osatengabe matendawo, anatero a kalirani.
Kalirani said the campaign will start in mid-March and will aim to reach everyone in the country, including people who are far from health facilities that provide HIV testing and counseling services. She said the campaign is in line with the goal of ending HIV infection by 2030. Malawi's HIV infection rate is currently at 10 percent, a slight drop from three years ago. 	A kalirani anati ntchitoyi iyamba mkatikati mwa mwezi wa Malichi ndipo afikira munthu aliyense amene ali ndi kachilombo kapena ayi, kuphatikizapo anthu amene anatalikilana ndi zipatala zazing'ono zomwe zimayeza magazi komanso kupereka uphungu. Iwo anati ntchitoyi ikulingana ndi cholinga chothetsa kutenga kachilombo ka HIV pofikira chaka cha 2030. 10% ndi mlingo wa katengedwe ka matendawa mu dziko lino komwe katsika kuchokera zaka zitatu zapitazo.
The announcement has raised fears in some Malawians, such as Steven Jailosi, a primary school teacher in rural Blantyre, who feel the campaign will likely infringe upon peoples privacy. 	Izi zitalengezedwa, zadzetsa mantha mwa amalawi ena ngati  a Steven Jailosi mphunzitsi wa sukulu ya pulaimale mu mzinda wa Blantyre amene akuona ngati  ntchitoyi idzaika zinsinsi za anthu poyera.
"""I think it is not okay because they will be invading our privacy. HIV testing is supposed to be private. No one is supposed to know that I went for an HIV testing unless I make a choice to tell them,"" said Jailosi. "	Ine ndikuona ngati njirayi siyabwino chifukwa ndizosemphana ndi moyo wathu wa Chinsinsi. Kuyezetsa magazi kumayenera kukhala kobisika. Palibe amene amayenera kudziwa zoti ndinapita kukayezetsa magazi pokhapokha nditapanga chisankho chomuuza, anatero a Jailosi.
Ester Makonokaya, a secretary in Blantyre, said that although she has been tested already, she feels the door-to-door HIV testing will violate people's privacy. 	 A Ester Makonokaya,  mlembi mu mzinda wa Blantyre anena kuti ngakhale iwo ayezedwa kale akuona kuti kuyeza magazi khomo ndi khomo ndi kuononga zinsinsi za anthu.
"""Government should instead take the mobile clinics to the villages where people will be able to access them on their own rather than taking testing in their homes, because that might mean that some of the people who are not supposed to know other peoples status will know because, you know, when someone has been tested you show some reactions,"" said Makonokaya. "	Boma likuyenera kutenga zipatala zoyendera mmidzi komwe anthu akakwanitse kuyezetsa pawokha kusiyana ndi kuyezedwa mmakomo mwawo, chifukwa anthu amene samayenera kudziwa zotsatira zawo atha kudziwa chifukwa munthu amene wayezedwa magazi khalidwe lake limasintha, anatero a Makonokaya.
"Macpherson Maulana, a journalist in Blantyre and a producer of radio programs on health, told VOA that government would do better to educate Malawians on the need for HIV testing so that people will go for tests on their own ""without being pushed."" "	A Macpherson Maulana, mtolankhani komanso wokonza ma pologalamu a zaumoyo  mu mzinda wa Blantyre anauza wailesi ya VOA kuti boma likuyenera kuphunzitsa anthu ubwino woyezetsa magatsi ndicholinga choti anthu akayezetse pawokha mosakakamizidwa.
"""I fear it could end up into fights. You see it happened in Liberia recently where people who were coming to help people suspected to have contracted Ebola were even killed. So, civic education is the most important element for people to be encouraged to come out for testing voluntarily,"" said Maulana. "	Ndikuopa kuti izi zitha kuyambitsa kumenyana. Ku dziko la Liberia pompano anthu amene anapita kukathandiza anthu owaganizira kuti anali ndi matenda a Ebola anaphedwa. Choncho anthuwa akuyenera kuwaphunzitsa kuti alimbikitsidwe kukayezetsa mwakufuna kwawo,  anatero a Maulana.
However, HIV/AIDS counselor David Odali, whose NGO Umunthu Foundation runs HIV-related projects, insisted privacy will be protected. 	Mlangizi wa matenda a HIV a David Odali omwe ali ndi bungwe lawo logwira ntchito zokhudzana ndi matenda a Edzi lotchedwa Umunthu Foundation anatsimikiza kuti zinsinsi za anthu ndi zotetezedwa.
"""Confidentiality will be upheld. Lets consider the household setup. I think the first thing would be to provide group counseling to members of that family. [Of course] people can be tested while others are watching, but when it comes to disclosing the results, a counselor is supposed to disclose that results to each and every individual separately,"" said Odali. "	Zinsinsi za anthu zidzasungidwa, tikatengera mmene nyumba imakhalira, chinthu choyambilira ndi kulangiza anthu a nyumba yonse pamodzi.

Odali said it will be up to the person who has been tested to disclose his or her status. 	A Odali anati zili kwa munthu yemwe wayezedwa kuulula zotsatira za magazi ake.
In 2006, the charity Development Aid from People to People conducted door-to-door HIV testing in the district of Thyolo and Blantyre, reaching 400,000 people. The organization says it worked well.

Water Crisis Raises Fears of Waterborne Disease in Malawi 	Kusowa kwa  madzi kwabweretsa mantha kwa Malawi odzetsa matenda amene amayamba ndi madzi opanda ukhondo.
Malawians in the country's commercial capital, Blantyre, usually rely on tap water. But for the past five months, the taps have often run dry, forcing residents to draw water from unprotected sources like rivers and wells, while work is being done at the city main pumping station.The risk of contracting water-borne diseases is rising.

Officials at the Blantyre Water Board attribute the problem largely to an ongoing European Union-funded project that seeks to install new pumping machines at Walkers Ferry, the main pumping station.  Priscilla Mateyu, the spokesperson for the Blantyre Water Board, says the project is expected to increase water production capacity to 105,000 cubic meters per day from the current daily production of 78,000 cubic meters.

The local consumer rights watchdog, the Consumers Association of Malawi, had been planning to hold vigils at the water board until the water supply was normalized, but the board asked protesters to hold off, promising to distribute water to residents through mobile water tanks.

"Local civil society groups said that ""by attempting to bribe the journalists"" Mutharika subjected his leadership style to disrepute. "	Magulu a anthu omwe siaboma anati a Mutharika sanaonetse khalidwe labwino pamene amayesera kuchita katangale ndi atolankhaniwo.
Meanwhile, some journalists are donating the money to charity. 	Pakadali pano atolankhani ena akupereka ndalamayo ku chithandizo.
Brian Ligomeka, the Managing Editor for the Times Group, told Times Television that all four employees there have donated the money to an orphanage. 	A Brian Ligomeka mkulu wa okonza nkhani ku Times Group, auza kanema ya Times television kuti ogwira ntchito anayi apereka ndalamayo kumalo osungila ana amasiye.
"""At first we decided to return the money to the president but we later thought it wise to buy assorted items like sugar, salt, notebooks and donate it to needy children,"" said Ligomeka. "	"""Poyambilira tinali ndi maganizo obwenza ndalamayo kwa mtsogoleri wathu koma tinaganiza mwanzeru kugula zinthu zosiyanasiyana ngati Shuga, mchere, makope ndi kukapereka kwa ana ovutika,"" anatero a Ligomeka."
"In his latest Sunday Times column, Raphael Tenthani, who also writes for BBC, apologized on behalf of other journalists ""for letting down the public that trust journalists unreservedly."" "	Mu tsamba lomwe amalemba lamulungu lilironse a Ralph Tenthani amene amalemberanso nyumba yofalitsa nkhani yaikulu ya BBC, anapepesa mmalo mwa atolankhani ena pokhumudzwitsa anthu amene amakhulupilira atolankhani ndi mtima wonse.
Tenthani has since donated the money for charity work and said that although the journalists could have done better if they returned the money right away, doing so would have been perceived as disrespect to the head of state. 	A Tenthani adapereka ndalamayo ku chithandizo ndipo anati  ngakhale atolankhaniwo anakachita bwino kukabwenza ndalamayo nthawi yomweyo, kutero kunakoneka ngati kusalemekeza mtsogoleri wadziko.
Maclan Kanyangwa, who heads the Department of Journalism and Media Studies at the Polytechnic College of the University of Malawi, said a media code of ethics bars journalists from accepting payment on a story. 	A Maclan kanyangwa mkulu wa chigawo cha atolankhani ndi maphunziro a zofalitsa nkhani ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya Polytechnic anati malamulo  a utolankhani amawaletsa kulandira ndalama pa nkhani iliyonse.
"""Obviously the meeting at the palace was the newsworthy event. There was a possibility that something was going to be published. And in the event that this payment would have influenced journalist decision [on news judgment], then that becomes a problem,"" said Kanyangwa. "	"""Mwachidziwikire msonkhanowu unali nkhani yaikulu yoyenera kudziwika kwa anthu. Panali kuthekera koti nkhaniyi ilembedwa mu masamba. Inakakhala kuti ndalamayi yasintha maganizo a atolankhani mu kaweluzidwe kawo ka nkhani, linakakhala vuto .' anatero  a Kanyangwa."
Kanyangwa said he feels many journalists failed to return the money immediately because they might have been out of their ethical senses when they got the money. 	A Kanyangwa anati akuona ngati atolankhani ambiri sanabweze ndalamayo chifukwa sanaganizire bwinobwino pamene alalandira.
Efforts to talk to Presidential Press Officer Fredrick Ndala were not successful. But some government authorities say the payment was not a bribe but meant for a fuel refund to those who attended the night event. 	Njira zonse zomwe tinayesa kulankhula ndi  mneneri wa mtsogoleri wa dziko a Fredrick Ndala sizinatheke. Koma akuluakulu ena a  boma anati ndalamayi siinali yakatangale koma inali yowabwezera ya mafuta a galimoto kwa anthu amene anabwera ku mwambowo.
Report: Manufacturing Could Free Poorest Nations From Poverty 	Lipoti: Maiko osaukitsitsa atha kuthetsa unphwawi pozipangila zipangizo pawokha mu mafakitale.
A new United Nations report urges the poorest countries in the world to shift from low- to high-productivity activities to improve their economies. 	Lipoti latsopano la Bungwe la United Nations lalimbikitsa maiko osaukitsitsa kuti asunthe kapangidwe kawo ka zinthu kufika patali ndicholinga chosintha chuma cha maiko awo.
"In its annual Least Developed Countries Report, UNCTAD — the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development — says these countries must structurally transform their economies to free themselves from the ""poverty trap,"" which is stunting economic growth and development. "	Mu lipoti la pa chaka lokhudza maiko osatukuka, a UNCTAD, ku msonkhano wa za ndalama ndi chitukuko anati maiko osaukawa akuyenera kudzimasula okha mu ngodya ya umphawi , yomwe ikuchedwetsa chitukuko ndi kusintha kwa chuma chawo.
"Of the 48 nations the U.N. considers ""Least Developed Countries"" (LDCs), only one, Laos, is on track to achieve all seven of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) by 2015. "	Pa maiko 48 amene bungwe la UN limati ndi osatukuka, dziko limodzi lokha  la Laos ndilimene likupita kokwanitsa zinthu zisanu ndi ziwiri zomwe likufuna pa njira yotchedwa Millenium development goals mu pofika chaka cha 2015.
Only four African countries — Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda — are likely to meet a majority of these targets. 	Maiko anayi okha mu Afilika, Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda ndi Uganda  ndi amene atha kukwanitsa zolinga zawo.
This assessment is particularly grim in light of the even greater challenges awaiting these countries in the coming years. The MDGs set a goal for nations to halve their poverty levels by 2015. The so-called Sustainable Development Goals, which carry on from where the MDGs leave off, call for eradication of poverty by 2030. 	Ntchito yomwe maikowa anapatsidwa itha kukanika  chifukwa cha mavuto akuluakulu amene maikowa angakumane nawo zaka zikubwerazi. A MDGs anaika malire kwa maiko osaukawa kuti achepetse umphawi ndi theka pofika chaka cha 2015. zomwe maikowa akufuna atafikira kuchokera pomwe a MDGs anasiyira zitha kuthetsa umphawi pofika chaka cha 2030.
According to Taffere Tesfachew, an UNCTAD official who works with African nations, it would be nothing short of a miracle for the LDCs to pull this off. 	A Taffere Tesfachew a bungwe la UNCTAD lomwe limagwira ntchito ndi maiko a ku Afilika anati zidzatengera chozizwa kuti mabungwe a LDCs adzathe kuchita izi.
In order for the least developed countries to achieve this miraculous performance, he says they will need to structurally change their economies. 	 Kuti maiko osatukukawa adzafikire pamenepa, akuyenera kusintha kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka chuma chawo.
He tells VOA this means shifting labor from activities with low productivity, such as small-scale agriculture and services to more dynamic activities with higher productivity, such as manufacturing and high-value services. 	Iwowa anauza wailesi ya VOA kuti izi zikutanthauza kuti kapangidwe ka zinthu komanso ulimi ukuyenera kusuntha kuchoka pa zokolora zochepa kufika ku zambiri, komanso anati akuyenera kupanga zinthu zobweretsa phindu lalikulu.
"""Countries that have moved up are the ones that are creating opportunities for those that are leaving agriculture to engage in things where they add value, where they get training and as it happens, manufacturing tends to have that sort of feature, that is why this call for manufacturing,"" he said. ""Countries that are using policies to shift and influence capital and labor to move into this activity sector tend to do better."" "	"""Maiko amene zinthu zawo zasintha ndi amene akupereka mwayi kwa anthu amene anasiya ulimi kuti akachite zinthu zina zoonjezera phindu, komwenso angachite maphunziro ake,  iwo anatero,"" ""Maiko amene amagwiritsa ntchito mfundo izi polimbikitsa ntchito yopanga zinthu okha amachita bwino."""
Tesfachew says these high-productivity sectors tend to pay higher wages and create a demand for goods. This, he says, encourages investment. 	A Tesfachew anati  zigawo zopanga katundu wochuluka malipiro ake amakhala ambiri komanso amabweretsa msika wa katunduyo. Iwo anati izi zimalimbikitsa  kuikako ndalama.
On the surface, it appears that the LDCs are not doing badly. UNCTAD economic data show growth in these poor countries between 2002 and 2008 exceeded the seven percent target set by the international community. And, even after the 2008 financial crisis, UNCTAD notes the LDCs grew faster than other developing countries, at an average of 5.7 percent per year. 	Zikuonetsa kuti a maiko a LDCs sakulephera kwambiri. Malipoti a ndalama a  bungwe la UNCTAD anaonetsa kusintha kwa maiko osaukawa pakati pa chaka cha 2002 ndi 2008 komwe anapitiliza mulingo wa 7 pelesenti omwe iwo amayenera kufikira. Ngahale papatatha vuto la ndalama la mu chaka cha 2008, bungwe la UNCTAD linaona kuti maiko osaukawa anachita bwino msanga kusiyana ndi maiko amene akutukuka ndi 5.7 pelesenti chaka chilichonse.
But U.N. economists say the outlook for the least developed countries in the short and medium term remains uncertain. They say increasing peoples productivity is the best way to break the patter of human and economic underdevelopment that continues to entrap them in poverty. 	Olondoloza ndalama a bungwe la U.N anati  maiko osatukukawa tsogolo lawo silikuoneka kwenikweni mu nthawi yochepa kapena yapakatikati. Iwo anati  kuchulutsa mlingo wa zinthu zopangidwa ndi anthu ndi njira imodzi yothetsera kusatukuka komwe kudakawaika mu umphwawi.
UN: Most African Nations to Miss 2015 MDG Goals 	UN: Maiko ambiri a ku Afilika alephera kufikira zolinga za chitukuko zotchedwa MDG za chaka cha 2015.
Most African countries will not reach the Millennium Development Goals set for 2015 because of the gap between economic and human development. That is one of the conclusions in this years annual U.N. report on the Least Developed Countries, presented Thursday. 	Maiko ambiri amu Afilika safikira zolinga zawo za chitukuko kufikira chaka cha 2015 chifukwa chakusiyana komwe kulipo pakati pa ndalama ndi chitukuko cha anthu. Izi zinali chimodzi cha mathero a kukambilana mu lipoti lokhudza maiko osatukuka  la bungwe la U.N lomwe linapelekedwa Lachinayi.
Junior Davis, U.N. economic affairs officer for Africa, said African countries have not been able to translate their economic growth into structural transformation. 	A Junior Davis amene amayan'ganira nkhani zokhudza ndalama mu Afilika kuchokera ku bungwe lla U.N, anati maiko a ku Afilika sanakwanitse  kusintha makulidwe a chuma chawo kupita ku kachitidwe ka mphamvu kopindulitsa.
"""We think that is the case because these countries have not focused efficiently on building what we call their productive capacities,"" Davis said. ""These are the basic human and economic development capacities that are needed to promote sustainable economic development. And the MDG, as they were constructed, largely ignored the need to develop the productive capacities."" "	Tikuona  ngati izi zili choncho chifukwa maikowa salimbikira kumanga kapena kuchita malonda ndi zinthu zomwe zingawabweretsere  phindu lochuluka, anatero a Davis.  Izi ndi zinthu zomwe zingabweretse  chitukuko cha chuma chokhazikika. Mmene malamulo  a MDGs anakonzedwera, kwakukulu amanyalanyaza kufunika kosintha zinthu zowabweletsera phindu.
Slow progress 	Kupita patsogolo pang'onopang'ono.
African countries also are not on course to halve poverty by 2015, and their overall progress on reducing hunger is relatively slow. Poverty limits human development and undermines productivity. And economic development is needed to make gains in human development. 	Maiko a mu Afilika Sali panjira yochepetsa umphawi ndi theka pofika chaka cha 2015, ndipo kupita pa tsogolo kwawo pochepetsa njala ndi kochedwa kwambiri. Umphawi umachepetsa chitukuko komanso uumapeputsa kachitidwe ka zinthu. Chitukuko cha zachuma chimayenera kupindula mu chitukuko cha anthu.
Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi are the only African countries on track to reach the majority of the development goals. They are making progress because they heavily invested in areas that create sustainable development such as infrastructure, health and education. 	Maiko a Ethiopia, Malawi ndi Rwanda ndi amene ali mu njira yokwanitsa njira za chitukukozi. Iwowa akupita patsogolo chifukwa adayika ndalama mu zitukuko zokhazikika monga, zomangamanga, zaumoyo ndi maphunziro.
The post-2015 development agenda for fragile countries where governance remains an issue — such as South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo — will still largely depend on support from the international community to achieve social and economic development, Davis said. 	Ndondomeko ya chitukuko ya chaka cha 2015 yokhudza maiko amene ulamuliro udakali nkhani yovuta, monga dziko la South Sudan ndi Democratic Republic of Congo, kwakukulu azidalirabe thandizo lochokera ku gulu la dziko lonse kuti  afikire chitukuko cha anthu ndi chuma, anatero a Davis. ndalama ndi chikhalidwe, anatero a Davis.
"Improvements in rural development, industrial productivity, agriculture and the services sectors in these countries will require ""ways in which we can have a pattern of growth which is not just sustainable but jobs-rich,"" Davis said. ""Because we see the growth in jobs and employment is central to any development strategy that aims to reduce poverty in a sustainable way."" "	"Kusintha chitukuko cha mmidzi, zokolola za makampani, ulimi ndi malo a ntchito mu maiko amenewa, payenera kukhala ndondomeko ya kukula kokhazikika komanso ntchito zolemera,"" anatero a Davis. ""Chifukwa tikuona kuti pali kuchuluka kwa ntchito komanso kalembedwe ka ntchito komwe kwa khazikika pa njira yachitukuko iliyonse yochepetsera umphawi mokhazikika."
A country is placed on the Least Developed Countries list based on its per capita income, economic vulnerability, and human development indicators such as health and nutrition. 	Dziko  limaikidwa pa ndandanda wa maiko osatukuka limatengera ndalama zabomalo, kusatetezeka kwa chuma komanso chitukuko cha anthu kudzera mu zaumoyo ndi zakudya.
Of the 48 least developed countries in the world, 34 are in Africa. Three countries have graduated from their least developed status: Botswana, Cape Verde and Samoa.

Strike Paralyzes Malawi's Judicial Services 	Kunyanyala ntchito ku ma ofesi oweruza milandu a ku Malawi kwaimitsa ntchito yawo.
A week-long strike by the support staff of Malawi's judiciary system has paralyzed the courts, causing overcrowding in police cells and the indefinite suspension of major cases - including government corruption trials. Court marshals, clerks and messengers are demanding the 30 percent salary increases promised by the government two years ago. 	Kunyanyala ntchito kwa sabata imodzi kwa anthu othandizira ntchito ku nthambi yoweruza milandu ya ku Malawi kwaimitsa ntchito za ma khoti, izi zachititsa kuchulukana mu malo amene amasungilamo anthu a kuba ku polisi komanso kuyimitsa milandu ikuluikulu monga ya katangale wa boma. Ma Marshal a khoti, ma kalaliki ndi ma mesinjala akufuna malipiro awo atakwezedwa kufika pa 30 pelesenti monga mmene boma linawalonjezera zaka ziwiri zapitazo.
Chanting and singing around the court premises has become a pastime activity for the striking court workers since the onset of a sit-in last week.  Linley Hebert, a spokesperson for the striking workers, told VOA the strike is a result of the governments failure to honor a 2012 agreement.   	Kuimba mozungulira malo a khotilo kwakhala chizolowezi cha anthu onyanyala ntchitowo kuchokera sabata yatha. A Linley Herbert, woyankhulira anthu onyanyala ntchitowa wauza wailesi ya VOA kuti kunyanyala ntchitoku ndi kamba ka kulephera kukwaniritsa lonjezo lomwe boma linapereka mu mgwirizano wawo chaka cha 2012.
"""In October [this year], the government reviewed the salaries of the civil servants, but we were not included in that revision,"" Hebert said.  "	"Mu mwezi wa Okotobala chaka chino, boma linakonzaso malipiro a anthu ogwira ntchito mb'oma, koma ife sitinaikidwe nawo mgululi,"" anatero a Herbert."
"""Yet in 2012, we had an agreement that each time they are revising the salaries of the civil servants, [they will be increasing our salaries as well].  "	"""Pamene chaka cha 2012 tinagwirizana  nawo kuti pamene akukonza malipiro a ogwira ntchito, azionjezeranso malipiro athu."
"So, [after adhering to the agreement in 2013], we are surprised to see that this time we are left out.""  Government authorities say the failure to increase judicial workers salaries this year is largely because of financial constraints, following a donor aid freeze against Malawi's government.  "	"Patatha mgwirizano wathu mu chaka cha 2013 tikudabwa kuti ulendo uno sanatiikepo."" akuluakulu aboma anati kulephera kukweza malipiro kwa ogwira ntchito mu ofesi yoweruza milandu ndichifukwa cha mavuto a zachuma, kuchokera ku kusiya kulandira chithandizo kwa dziko la Malawi kuchokera kwa othandiza."
The freeze is a result of a government financial scandal in which more than $30 million was looted from government coffers.  Ministry of Finance spokesperson Nations Msowoya told a local radio station it is hard for the government to meet the workers' demand.   	Kuimitsa kulandira thandizoku ndi chifukwa cha ndalama zoposa 30 miliyoni zomwe zinabedwa ndiogwira ntchito m'boma. Mneneri wa unduna wa za chuma a Nations Msowoya anauza wailesi ina kuti ndizovuta kuti dziko lifikire zofuna za ogwira ntchitowa.
"""It is difficult to promise what the treasury will do. But suffice to say that the prevailing economic circumstances and budgetary constraints will make a little bit difficult for the treasury to bow down to the demands,"" ""Msowoya said. "	"""Ndizovuta kulonjeza zomwe asungi chuma angachite. Koma titha kunena kuti ndimmene nyengo yachuma iliri ndi zopinga za bajeti, zikhala zovutirapo kuchita monga mmene iwo akufunira,"" anatero a Msowoya."
"But according to Hebert, the strikers will not resume work until their demands are met.  ""Since I was born [there has been] no time the government said it had some money.  "	"A Herbert anati athu onyanyala ntchitowo  sayambiranso  kugwira ntchito pokhapokha atalandira zofuna zawo. "" Chibadwileni changa palibe nthawi yomwe a boma ananena kuti ali ndi ndalama."
"It has its own means [of finding the money] and it will find the same means to give us the money,"" Hebert insisted.  The ongoing strike is hampering progress of trials, as court operations remain suspended.   "	"Boma liri ndi njira zake zopezera ndalama ndipo lipeza njira zomwezo kutipatsa ife ndalama,"" ananenetsa a Herbert. Kunyanyala ntchitoku kukusokoneza kuzenga milandu pamene ntchito za khoti zaimitsidwa."
Several trials, including that of former justice minister Ralph Kasambara, who is answering charges in connection with the financial scandal, were indefinitely suspended last week.   	Milandu yambiri kuphatikizapo wa nduna yakale za za chilungamo a Ralph Kasambara, amane akuyankha mlandu polumikizana ndi kuba ndalamaku inaimitsidwa sabata latha.
Police are complaining of congestion in jail cells, as no suspects are being taken to court.  	Apolisi akudandaula kuchulukana kwa anthu mu ndende  pamene anthu owakaikira ndi milandu sakutengedwa ku khoti.
"Malawi police spokesperson Rhoda Manjolo told VOA the only option they have is ""giving police bail to those with minor offenses.""   Human rights campaigners and legal experts say the strike is contributing to human rights violations.   "	Mneneri wa polisi  a Rhoda Manjolo anauza wailesi ya VOA kuti kuti njira yokhayo yomwe alinayo ndi  kuwatulutsa kaye  anthu amene ali ndi zolakwa zazing'ono. Anthu omenyera ufulu ndi malamulo akuti kunyanyala ntchitoku kukuphwanya malamulo a ufulu wa anthu.
"""There are those people who have to be taken to court within 48 hours,"" noted Lawyer George Kadzipatike who works in a private practice in the northern city of Mzuzu. ""We cannot make application for them to be granted bail.  "	"""Pali anthu ena amene akuyenera kukaonekera ku khoti maola 48 asanathe,"" anatero oyimira milandu a George Kadzipatike amene amagwira ntchito pawokha ku mpoto kwa mzinda wa Mzuzu. ""Sitingawalembele kuti iwo atulutsidwe kaye."
"There are those people who do not want to live with their partners, they would like the court to decree that they be divorced, we cannot file any petition through the courts.""   "	"Pali anthu ena amene sakufuna kukhala limodzi ndi okondedwa awo, akufuna khoti litawasudzula, sitingakwanitse kupempha kudzera ku khoti."""
Government authorities say closed door negotiations to resolve the matter continue in the capital, Lilongwe.  But the striking workers told VOA whatever the case, they will accept nothing short of a 30 percent increase in their salaries.   	Akuluakulu a boma anati akuchita zokambirana mu mzinda wa Lilongwe kuti alongosole nkhaniyi. Koma onyanyala ntchitoyi awuza wailesi ya VOA kuti iwo savomera kukwezedwa  malipiro ochepera 30%.
A similar strike lasted three months in 2012 after the magistrates and judges joined the labor action. 	Kunyanyala ntchito ngati komweku kunatenga  miyezi itatu  mu chaka cha 2012 pamene oweruza milandu anachita nawo.
Famine in Southern Africa Worse Than Predicted - 2002-07-24 	Chilala ku mmwera kwa Afilika chiipiraipira kusiyana ndi mmene zinanenedwela- 2002-07-24
The United Nations World Food Program says the famine in southern Africa is even worse than predicted. WFP officials are warning that 13 million people in six countries: Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Mozambique are in danger of starvation if they do not get food aid. 	Mgwirizano wa dziko lonse wokhudza chakudya ( United Nations World Food Program) wati chilala ku mmwera  kwa Afilika chaipiraipira kusiyana ndi mmene amaganizira. Akuluakulu a bungwe la WFP achenjeza  kuti anthu okwana 13 million mmaiko a Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho, Swazilandi ndi Mozambique  ali pa chiopsezo ngati salandira thandizo la chakudya.
"World Food Program officials say they need one million tons of food to alleviate hunger in southern Africa, but they are not confident they will get it. In an appeal to the international community at the beginning of July, WFP officials asked for more than $0.5 billion to buy food. So far they have received only 20 percent of that. WFP's director for the southern Africa region, Judith Lewis, says the situation is getting desperate. ""The window of opportunity to avert what could be a major humanitarian crisis is closing,"" she said. ""We need more assistance now. We need food on the high seas now, or we need cash to buy commodities that are still available in southern Africa, so we can avert this major, major crisis."" "	"Akuluakulu a World Food program ati akufunika  ma tani 1 million a chakudya kuti achepetse njala ku mmwera kwa Afilika, koma iwo alibe chikhulupiliro kwenikweni kuti atha kuchipeza. Pempho lomwe anapempha ku gulu lapadziko lonse lapansi kumayambiliro kwa mwezi wa Julayi, akuluakulu a  WFP anapempha ndalama zopitilira 0.5 biliyoni zogulira chakudya. Koma pakadali pano iwo alandira gawo la 20 pelesenti la ndalamayo. Wotsogolera gulu la WFP ku mmwera kwa Afilika a Judith Lewis, anati vutoli likupita kuwasowetsa chiyembekezo. ""Mwayi omwe unapezeka  othetsera  vuto lalikululi ukutsekedwa,"" iwo anatero. ""Tikufuna chithandizo chochuluka tsopano. Tikufuna chakudya chochuluka kapena ndalama zoti tigulire katundu yemwe adakapezeka kummwera kwa Afilika kuti tichepetse vuto lalikululi."
Currently, the WFP is assisting six million of the most vulnerable people in the six most severely affected countries. About half of these people are in Zimbabwe. The agency says it is sure the number of people needing its help will rise. 	Pakadali pano bungwe la WFP likuthandiza anthu amene ali pa chiopsezo okwana 6 miliyoni ku maiko omwe akhudzidwa kwambiri. Theka la anthuwa ndi ochokera ku dziko la Zimbabwe. Nthambiyi inati ali ndi chikhulupiliro kuti chiwerengero cha anthuwa chikula.
The World Health Organization notes southern Africa, in addition to having the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the world, also has the world's highest chronic malnutrition rates. It predicts about 300,000 people could die over the next six months from diseases related to malnutrition. 	Bungwe loona zaumoyo dziko lonse lapansi la World Health Organisation lati maiko a  kummwera kwa Afilika  poonjezerapo kukhala ndi anthu ochuluka a matenda a Edzi padziko lonse, lilinso ndi chiwelengelo chochuluka cha anthu osoya zakudya  mthupi. iwo anati anthu 300,000 atha kufa ndi matenda osowa chakudyawa pa miyezi isanu ndi umodzi ikubwerayi.
"Ms. Lewis says the dying has already begun. ""We are seeing people moving from their villages,"" she said. ""If they know there is going to be a food distribution, they immediately go there. The problem is we do not even have enough food to feed the people who are on the rolls, let alone add food for other people in the areas. Is there a potential to become chaotic? Yes. "" "	"Mai Lewis anati anthu ayamba kale kufa. ""anthu akumasamuka mmidzi mwawo, kupita ku malo omwe amvetsedwa kuti kuli chakudya. Vuto ndilakuti tilibe chakudya chokwanira choti tingawadyetse anthu omwe ali pa ndandandawa komanso omwe ali mmadera ena. Kodi pali kuthekera koti zitha kubweretsa chipwirikiti ? eya."""
WFP'S Judith Lewis says at this time of year the agency is usually planning how to get food supplies into the region before the rainy season hits in October. But she says since the WFP is already having difficulty meeting its present targets, it can't even begin to plan for future food deliveries. 	A Judith Lewiis a bungwe la WFP anati nthawi ngati ino mu chaka chilichonse nthambiyi imakhala ikukonzekera mmene ingapezere chakudya cha maderawa nyengo yamvula isanayambe mu  mwezi wa Okotobala. Koma iwo anati poti bungwe la WFP likupeza kale mavuto kukwaniritsa  mmene amafunira, sangayambe kukonzekera ndondomeko ina yopereka zakudya mttsogolomu.

Alliance leaders are pressing President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party for a role in a transitional government. They had organized a demonstration Monday in Bulawayo, the country's second-largest city, but police authorities banned it hours before its intended start.

Civil Society Workers Run Afoul of Tanzania Security Officials in Sign of Increasing Clampdown 	Anthu osagwira ntchito m'boma, atsutsana ndi akuluakulu a chitetezo m'boma la Tanzania poletsa machitidwe a zinthu.
African civil society campaigners attending a conference in Tanzania were questioned and warned over the weekend, in what human rights activists say is part of a continuing clampdown on free speech in the East African nation. 	Anthu a mu Afilika osagwira ntchito m'boma omwe akukumana nawo pa msonkhano ku Tanzania anafunsidwa komanso kuchenjezedwa mathero a sabatayi,mu zimene omenyera ufulu wa anthu amati ndi njira imodzi yoletsera ufulu wa malankhulidwe mu dera la East Africa.
Details are still emerging over what exactly happened to at least 40 civil society workers who ran afoul of security officials at this year's summit of the Southern African Development Community in Dar es Salaam. 	Zambiri zikutulukirabe pa zomwe zinachitika kwa anthu makumi anayi osagwila ntchito m'boma amene anali pa mkangano ndi akuluakulu a chitetezo pa msonkhano waukulu wotukula maiko a kummwera kwa Africa  wotchedwa Southern African Development Community ku Dar es Salaam.
But rights experts said Monday that the episode is another worrying sign of heightened paranoia and harassment from the government. 	Koma akatswiri a za ufulu Lolemba anati gawo ili ndi  chizindikiro china chodandaulitsa pa kuchuluka kosowa chikhulupiliro ndi nkhanza kuchokera ku boma.
Catherine Eden, a lawyer for the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition, says the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding. South African delegates to the 15-nation conference, she said, wanted to hold a short commemoration of the seventh anniversary of South Africa's deadly Marikana mine massacre on Aug. 16. Thirty-four striking miners were killed by police in the deadliest security incident since the end of apartheid in 1994. 	A Catherine Eden, woimila milandu ku bungwe la Tanzania Human Rights Coalition, anati zomwe zinachitikazo zinayambira pa kusamvetsetsana. Nthumwi khumi ndi zisanu zochokera ku dziko la South Africa, iwo anati, zinafuna kuchita chikumbutso patatha zaka zisanu ndi ziwiri pa anthu ambiri omwe anaphedwa ku mgodi wa ku Marikana pa 16 mwezi wa Ogasiti. Okumba migodi makumi atatu ndi anayi omwe ankachita zionetsero anaphedwa ndi apolisi, mu kuphedwa kochuluka chitheleni ulamuliro wa tsankho mu chaka cha 1994.
So delegates at a side event sang the South African anthem, held a moment of silence and availed on their government to better protect its people. But something they wrote on a piece of paper convinced security police the delegates had bigger plans. 	Nthumwi pa zochitika zina zinayimba nyimbo ya fuko la dziko la South  Africa, anakhala ndi mphindi ya chete ndipo anauza boma lawo kuti likuyenera kuteteza anthu awo. Koma chinthu china chomwe analemba pa pepala chinatsimikizila a polisi a chitetezo kuti nthumwizo zinali ndi zolinga zina zazikulu.
"""They wrote some messages on the flip charts, of which the little content that was captured in the flip charts read, 'Stop killing our people,'"" she said. ""... So I think there was a national security person in that meeting and he saw those messages and so he interpreted that as a plan to demonstrate. But if you look closely, you can't see any relationship as to why they would want to demonstrate for the Marikana shootings in Tanzania."" "	"""Iwo analemba ma uthenga pa mapepala akuluakulu, amene pa zooneka zomwe zomwe anajambula anati, 'lekani kupha anthu athu', iwo anatero. Ndikuona ngati munali munthu wachitetezo cha boma mu msonkhanowo yemwe anaona mauthengawo ndikuwamasulira ngati kuti panali dongosolo lochita zionetsero. Koma mukaona bwinobwino palibe ubale wina uliwonse woonetsa kuti amafuna kuchita zionetsero chifukwa cha kuombera kwa a Marikana ku Tanzania."
It's not clear if anyone was actually arrested. Other rights groups say that some foreign campaigners were arrested, but not interrogated. 	Sizikudziwika bwino ngati panali amene anamangidwa.

Eden says she was summoned by authorities as she went to the police station Friday night to meet with a local coordinator and then was let go with a warning.

UN Condemns Government Crackdown on Peaceful Protests in Zimbabwe 	A bungwe la UN adzudzula boma la Zimbabwe pa mchitidwe wolanga anthu pa zionetsero zamtendere zomwe zinachitika.
The U.N. human rights office is condemning a crackdown Friday in Zimbabwe by riot police on peaceful protesters in the capital, Harare.

Zimbabwes citizens are struggling with hyperinflation, which has sent prices soaring for essential commodities such as fuel, food, transportation and health care.

Despite Oil and Gas Reserves, Africa Feels Pressure of Rising Energy Costs 	Ngakhale pali mafuta osungidwa, Africa wakhudzidwa ndi kukwera mtengo kwa mphamvu zochokera ku mafuta.
Africans are feeling the pinch caused by soaring global energy prices, say analysts, even in countries like Nigeria and Angola that are major exporters of crude oil. 	Anthu a ku Afilika akupeza mavuto ndi kukwera kwa mafuta ndi mphamvu ya magetsi, anatero ounguza, ngakhalenso maiko a Nigeria ndi Angola amene amagulitsa  mafuta ku maiko ena.
While that handful of oil producers is seeing an increase in revenue – especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24 – much of the continent lacks refining capability, forcing countries to pay high prices to import gasoline and other petroleum products from Asia and Europe. 	Pamene opanga mafuta ochepa ena akupeza ndalama yochuluka, chiyambileni kuukila kwa dziko la Russia ku Ukraine pa 24 Febuluwale,  dzikoli likukanika kukonza mafutawa zomwe zikukakamiza maiko kulipira mitengo yokwera kuti abweretse  mafuta ndi zina kuchokera kmaiko a ku  Asia ndi ku Ulaya.
The continent is further affected by increasing costs for natural gas, a key component of nitrogen-based fertilizers used in food production. 	Dziko likupitilira kukhudzidwa ndi kukwera mtengo  kwa mafuta a chilengedwe amene amaagwiritsidwa ntchito mu feteleza wokulitsa mbewu za chakudya.
With salaries largely stagnant, more than two-thirds of Africans feel pressured by the rising prices, said Franklin Cudjoe, founding president of the Ghana-based Imani Center for Policy and Education.

"""The continent is affected simply because we depend largely on global oil suppliers, since not many African countries have [their own] oil products,"" Cudjoe told VOA. "	"Gawo la dzikoli lakhudzidwa kwambiri chifukwa timadalira kwambiri  kugula mafuta ochokera ku maiko ena, monga maiko ambiri aku Afilika alibe mafuta opanga okha,"" a Cudjoe anauza wailesi ya VOA."
Prices spiked on the global oil market after the invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of international sanctions against Russia, one of the worlds leading exporters of crude. The price briefly climbed to over $120 per barrel this month before settling down to $103 per barrel on Friday. 	Mitengo inakwera pa msika wa dziko lonse pambuyo pa kuukilidwa kwa dziko la Ukraine komwe kunayambitsa kusintha kwa malamulo a dziko lonse motsutsana ndi dziko la Russia, limodzi mwa maiko otumiza mafuta ku maiko ena. Mwachidule mtengo unakwera kuposela pa 120 dolazi pa galoni iliyonse lachisanu asanagwirizane zotsitsa kufika pa 103 dolazi.
The surge in energy prices is helping to fuel inflation across Africa. In Ghana, for example, overall consumer price inflation was pegged at 15.7% year-on-year in February compared with 13.9% in January, the countrys Statistical Service said last week. 	Kukwera mitengo kwamphamvu  ya magetsi, ndikomwe kukuchititsa kukwera mitengo ya zinthu ku Afilika.

In Zimbabwe, prices are climbing sharply – even overnight. At a TM supermarket in the capital of Harare, a crate of 30 eggs cost the $6.70 on Tuesday and about $7.81 on Wednesday. The price of a loaf of bread went from $1.49 to $1.84; for a kilo of beef, the price jumped from $3.35 to $5.22. 	Ku dziko la Zimbabwe mitengo ikukwera kwambiri. Sitolo ina yotchedwa TM ku Harare, kileti ya mazira 30 ndi ma dolazi okwana 6.70 lachiwiri, lachitatu anali ma dolazi okwana 7.81.

The surge in food prices was the biggest driver behind consumer inflation in Egypt, it rose by 8.8% in February – the sharpest increase in nearly three years, according to the state statistics agency, CAPMAS. 	Kukwera kwa mitengo ya zakudya ndi komwe kunachititsa kukwera mitengo kwa ogula zinthu mu dziko la  Aigupto (Egypt), inakwera kufika pa  8.8 % mwezi wa Febuluwale. Kukwera kwachangu mu zaka zitatu, malinga ndi ziwerengero za nthambi ya CAPMAS.
Cudjoe said it was crucial for governments and regional bodies such as the African Union to build defenses to cushion consumers in times of economic uncertainty. 	A Cudjoe anati zinali zovuta kwa maboma  ndi madera ngati a African Union kuti apange njira zodzitetezera podzathandizira anthu ogula zinthu mu nyengo ya kusatsimikizika kwa chuma.
"""Even if it means building defenses in terms of the provision of food,"" said Cudjoe, adding, ""I could imagine Nigeria, if it had had its way, it could be selling foodstuff to most countries at reduced rates by now."" "	"Ngakhale kutamangidwa chitetezo  mu njira yopeleka chakudya,"" anatero a Cudjoe poonjezera, ""Ndikulingalira dziko la Nigeria, linakakhala ndi njira yake bwezi likugulitsa chakudya  ku maiko ambiri motsika mtengo panopa."""
"""There must be that urgency of building for themselves defenses, funds that would make us sustain ourselves -- at least to prevent us from being completely annihilated by these uncertainties in the world."" "	"""Pakuyenera kukhala changu chodzimangira chitetezo, ndalama zoti zitha kutisunga-zotipewetsa kuwonongeka ku kusatsimikizidwa kwa  zinthu zochitika pa dzilo lonse."
"Chibamba Kanyama, an economist in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, said suspending fuel taxes would be ""the most ideal thing to do now under the circumstances"" to cushion consumers and industries. "	A Chibamba kanyama, oona zachuma mu mzinda wa Lusaka ku Zambia, anati kuchotsa misonkho ya mafuta chitha kukhala chinthu choyenera kuchita panopa ndi nyengoyi poteteza anthu ogula ndi mafakitale.
"""African governments must find a way of responding,"" he said.

But Kanyama also suggested that the geopolitical crisis involving Russia and Ukraine – both big grain exporters to Africa – may create opportunities for African producers. 	Koma a Kanyama anapereka maganizo oti zovuta za maiko zomwe zikuchitika pakati pa Russia ndi Ukraine amene ali maiko ogulitsa katundu ku Afilika, zitha kupereka mwayi ochuluka  kwa opanga zinthu zosiyanasiyana ku Afilika.

A number of Zimbabweans have refused vaccination, saying they do not trust the mainly donated Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines. The country has lately recorded a rise in new infections – now cumulatively at 244,012 with 5,418 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the global outbreak.

"""This (index) presents a stark reminder of the material and immaterial damage that war does to its many victims,"" co-author Jan-Emmanuel De Neve said. The World Happiness Report, now in its 10th year, is based on people's own assessment of their happiness, as well as economic and social data. "	Mumulingo umenewu ukuimilira kukumbutsa mmene mulungo unalili wa zipangizo komanso zomwe sizipangizo zomwe nkhondo inachita kwa okhudzidwa, co-author  Jan-Emmanuel De Neve  anatero.
