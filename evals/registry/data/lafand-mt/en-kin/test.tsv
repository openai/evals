UNICEF Pushes for Demobilizing Child Soliders Near Africa's Great Lakes - 2002-10-07	UNICEF irashyira ingufu mu kuvana abana mu gisirikare mu karere k'ibiyaga bigari bya Afurika - 2002-10-07
The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, is pushing for child soldiers to be demobilized in Africa's Great Lakes region, as several peace drives there build momentum. 	Ishami ry’umuryango w’abibumbye ryita ku bana, UNICEF, rirasaba ko abana b’abasirikare bavanwa mu gisirikare mu karere k’ibiyaga bigari bya Afurika, kubera ko amahoro menshi ari ho agaragarira.
The agency says funding is in place to help the children leave the military and restart their lives.	Iki kigo kivuga ko inkunga ihari yo gufasha abana kuva mu gisirikare no gutangira ubuzima bwabo.
UNICEF's top child protection official, Manuel Fontaine, says peace initiatives in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are making it possible to get more children under the age of 18 out of fighting units. 	Umuyobozi mukuru ushinzwe kurengera abana muri UNICEF, Manuel Fontaine, avuga ko ingamba z’amahoro muri Uganda, Repubulika Iharanira Demokarasi ya Kongo no mu Rwanda zituma bishoboka ko abana benshi bari munsi y’imyaka 18 bava mu mitwe irwana.
"""We insist that child soldiers could be demobilized, even in conflict situations. "	Turashimangira ko abana b'abasirikare bakwiriye kuva mu gisirikare, ndetse no mu bihe by'amakimbirane.
We should never wait for peace to get children out of any form of armed group. 	Ntidukwiye na rimwe gutegereza amahoro kugira ngo abana bavanwe mu mutwe uwo ari wo wose witwaje intwaro.
"But, obviously, that's a better timing at the moment. It's more conducive to demobilization,"" Mr. Fontaine said."	Ariko, ikigaragara ni uko iki ari igihe cyiza cyo kubikora. Bizadufasha cyane nibava mu gisirikare, Bwana Fontaine ni ko yavuze.
He says there are currently 1,200 child soldiers in Uganda, fighting mainly with the rebel Lord's Resistance Army. He says that over the past 14 years, the group has abducted some 10,000 children, boys to fight and girls to serve as sex slaves.	Avuga ko muri Uganda muri iki gihe hari abasirikare 1200 b'abana, barwana ahanini n'ingabo za Lord Resistance Army. Avuga ko mu myaka 14 ishize, iryo tsinda ryashimuse abana bagera ku 10,000, abahungu bajyanwa kurwana n'ab’abakobwa kugira ngo bagirwe imbata z’imibonano mpuzabitsina.
According to UNICEF, The Democratic Republic of Congo still has some 10,000 children recruited to fight, while Rwanda has up to 2,000 children involved in combat.	UNICEF ivuga ko Repubulika Iharanira Demokarasi ya Kongo igifite abana bagera ku 10,000 binjijwe mu ntambara, mu gihe u Rwanda rufite abana bagera ku 2000 bagize uruhare mu ntambara.
UNICEF says, even though some of the children do not directly engage in fighting, they are exposed to many dangers. 	UNICEF ivuga ko, nubwo bamwe mu bana batishora mu mirwano, bahura n'ingaruka nyinshi.
They may be used as porters, carrying very heavy loads, or as messengers or spies passing information and scouting out enemy territory.	Bashobora gukoreshwa nk'abatwara ibintu, batwara imitwaro iremereye cyane, cyangwa nk'intumwa cyangwa abatasi batanga amakuru kandi bagashakisha agace k'umwanzi.
Sometimes, boys, but mainly girls, are used as sex slaves. They are exposed to violence and HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. 	Rimwe na rimwe, abahungu, ariko cyane cyane abakobwa, bakoreshwa nk'abacakara. Bahura n’ihohoterwa na Virus itera SIDA n'izindi ndwara zandurira mu mibonano mpuzabitsina.
The girls may become pregnant, making it harder for them to reintegrate into their communities.	Abakobwa bashobora gusama, bikabagora gusubira mu miryango yabo.
UNICEF's Manuel Fontaine says demobilization takes time and money. 	Manuel Fontaine wa UNICEF avuga ko gusubiza mu buzima busanzwe bitwara igihe n'amafaranga.
He says the children must first be found, and then removed from their government or rebel units.	Avuga ko abana bagomba kubanza kuboneka, hanyuma bakavanwa muri guverinoma cyangwa mu mitwe y'inyeshyamba.
Then, resources are needed to help them rebuild their lives. That involves providing schools, vocational training and health care.	Noneho, ibikoresho bikabona gukenewe kugira ngo bibafashe kubaka ubuzima bwabo. Ibyo bikubiyemo gutanga amashuri, amahugurwa y'imyuga no kwita ku buzima.
"""You do not want to stigmatize them and individualize them. "	Ntawifuza kubatesha agaciro no kubatandukanya.
They are basically going back to communities where there are a lot of other children, many of whom have suffered from consequences of war, even if they were not recruited. 	Basanzwe ahanini basubira mu baturage aho usanga hari abandi bana benshi, benshi muri bo bakaba baratewe n'ingaruka z'intambara, kabone niyo baba batinjijwe mu gisirikare.
"So, you are trying to build services in those communities that are broad services, that would be made available to all those children,"" Mr. Fontaine said."	Rero, uragerageza kubaka serivisi muri iyo miryango ari serivisi zagutse, zizahabwa abo bana bose , Bwana Fontaine.
Mr. Fontaine says, as part of various peace packages in the Great Lakes region, the World Bank and other donors are providing $500 million to help demobilize children. 	Bwana Fontaine avuga ko, mu rwego rwo guharanira amahoro atandukanye mu karere k'ibiyaga bigari, Banki y'Isi n'abandi baterankunga batanga miliyoni 500 z'amadolari yo gufasha abana mu bikorwa.
He says, unfortunately, the needed government institutions are not yet in place in some countries to move the process ahead quickly enough. 	Avuga ko ikibabaje ari uko inzego za Leta zikenewe zitarashyirwaho mu bihugu bimwe na bimwe kugira ngo inzira igerweho vuba bihagije.
He says that's why UNICEF is pressing to see such structures develop, so that children can get back home and start to lead normal lives once again.	Avuga ko ari yo mpamvu UNICEF irihatira kubona izo nzego zitera imbere, kugira ngo abana basubire mu rugo batangire kubaho ubuzima busanzwe.

"""My name is Sanchita. I come from a small village called Ishwarpur in Bangladesh,"" American actress Anne Hathaway delivered her lines as powerfully from behind a podium at the World Bank as she does on the silver screen, telling the story of an impoverished girl."	"Nitwa Sanchita. Nkomoka mu mudugudu muto witwa Ishwarpur muri Bangladesh."" Umukinnyi w'amafirime ukomoka muri Amerika, Anne Hathaway, yatanze umurongo ukomeye cyane inyuma ya podium kuri Banki y'Isi nk'uko abikora kuri ecran ya silver, avuga amateka y'umukobwa ukennye."
"""When a baby is born in Ishwarpur, families desperately hope it will be a boy,"" she continued. ""It has been this way for as long as anyone can remember."	"Yakomeje agira ati: ""Iyo umwana avukiye Ishwarpur, imiryango ntiba yizeye ko azaba umuhungu."" ""Byabaye gutya igihe cyose umuntu ashobora kwibuka."
It is believed that boys will contribute to the family income in a place where people are very poor.	Byizerwa ko abahungu bagira uruhare mu muryango rwo kwinjiza umutungo ahantu abantu bakennye cyane.
"""These circumstances are familiar to those who benefit from the Adolescent Girls Initiative."	Ibi bihe biramenyerewe ku bantu bungukirwa n'ibikorwa by'abakobwa b'abangavu bafata iyambere.
Who benefits?A dozen such teenage girls and young women visited the World Bank from developing Asian, Middle Eastern and African countries.	Ninde ubyungukiramo? Abakobwa cumi na babiri n’abagore bakiri bato basuye Banki y'isi baturutse mu bihugu bya Aziya, Uburasirazuba bwo hagati na Afurika.
They were just a few of the girls who benefit from training and education programs that help them transition from school to employment.	Bari bake mu bakobwa bungukirwa n'amahugurwa na gahunda y'uburezi bibafasha kuva mu mashuri bajya mu kazi.
Hathaway told the audience that, with the help of a development organization, Sanchita gained an education and borrowed $60 to buy a cow and start a vegetable garden.	Hathaway yabwiye abari aho ko, abifashijwemo n’umuryango w’iterambere, Sanchita yize amashuri maze aguza amadorari 60 yo kugura inka no gutangiza ubusitani bw'imboga.
The teenage girl could then afford to pay her own school fees, as well as her brother's, and contribute to her family in such a way that Sanchita's parents hope she does not marry any time soon.	Umukobwa w'umwangavu noneho yashoboraga kwiyishyurira amafaranga y'ishuri, kimwe na murumuna we, akanatanga umusanzu mu muryango we ku buryo ababyeyi ba Sanchita bizeye ko atazashyingirwa vuba.
Hathaway spoke of her own childhood in a comfortable suburban U.S. neighborhood, and of a time when she had no idea about the kind of circumstances Sanchita faced nor how much girls need safe spaces for education.	Hathaway yavuze ubwana bwe mu mugi mwiza n'abaturanyi bo muri Amerika, kandi mu gihe atigeze atekereza ku byerekeye ibihe Sanchita yahuye na byo cyangwa uko abakobwa bakeneye ahantu hizewe kugira ngo bige.
"""Places that could teach them how to take the light they have as girls and ignite the world,"" explained Hathaway."	"Hathaway yasobanuye agira Ari: ""Ahantu hashobora kubigisha gufata umucyo bafite nk'abakobwa no kumurikira isi."""
"""I wouldn't know how much the world needs 'The Girl Effect.'"" Girl power""The Girl Effect"" is what the Adolescent Girls Initiative wants to see happen for 600 million girls in developing countries."	"Ntabwo nari kumenya uko isi ikeneye 'Uruhare rw'umukobwa."" ""Imbaraga z'umukobwa"" Uruhare rw'umukobwa ""ni cyo Gufata iyambere bishaka kwerekana ku bakobwa miliyoni 600 mu bihugu bikiri mu nzira y'amajyambere."
Overall, an estimated one-third of young women in developing nations are not employed and not in school.World Bank President Robert Zoellick said underinvesting in girls impedes development.	Muri rusange, abagera kuri kimwe cya gatatu cy’abagore bakiri bato mu bihugu bikiri mu nzira y'amajyambere ntibakoreshwa kandi ntibari no mu ishuri. Perezida wa Banki y'Isi, Robert Zoellick, yavuze ko gushora imari mu bakobwa bidindiza iterambere.
He added that educating girls also makes sense for poor families, noting that an extra year of secondary schooling can raise their wages by 10 to 20 percent.	Yongeyeho ko kwigisha abakobwa na byo byumvikana ku miryango ikennye, anagaragaza ko umwaka w’inyongera w’amashuri yisumbuye ushobora kuzamura umushahara wabo kugeza kuri 10%.
"""If they earn greater income they also have greater access to reproductive health information and services, so then more likely to delay marriage and childbirth, have healthier babies and attain higher literacy rates,"" Zoellick said."	"Zoellick ati: ""Niba binjiza amafaranga menshi kandi bafite amahirwe menshi yo kumenya amakuru na serivisi z'ubuzima bw'imyororokere, birashoboka cyane ko batinda gushaka no kubyara, bakagira abana bafite ubuzima bwiza kandi bakabona umubare munini w'abazi gusoma no kwandika""."
"""The evidence strongly suggests that investing in adolescent girls is a key way to break inter-generational patterns of poverty."""	"Ibimenyetso byerekana neza ko gushora imari mu bakobwa b'ingimbi ari inzira y'ingenzi yo guca ukubiri n''ubukene. """

Activists Press for Better Help to End Congo Rapes	Abanyamakuru baharanira gufasha mu guhagarika gufata ku ngufu muri congo.
As U.N. Special Representative for Sexual Violence In Conflict Margot Wallstrom embarks on a new trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, two activists recently concluded lobbying efforts in the United States for more effective action on trying to end conflict-related rapes in Congo.	Mu gihe uhagarariye Umuryango w’abibumbye ushinzwe ihohoterwa rishingiye ku gitsina mu makimbirane Margot Wallstrom atangiye urugendo rushya muri Repubulika Iharanira Demokarasi ya Kongo, abarwanashyaka babiri baherutse gusoza ibikorwa byo guharanira inyungu muri Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika kugira ngo barusheho gufata ingamba zo gushaka guhagarika ihohoterwa rishingiye ku makimbirane muri Kongo.
One of them, Justine Masika Bihamba, told a gathering of Washington, D.C., university students and concerned citizens that the area in which she works, Beni, in North Kivu province, is still overrun by Ugandan rebels who regularly rape women.She said in these situations women are considered victims, and are not implicated in the search for peace.	Umwe muri bo, Justine Masika Bihamba, yabwiye abari bateraniye i Washington, muri Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika, abanyeshuri ba kaminuza ndetse n’abaturage bireba ko akarere akoreramo, Beni, mu ntara ya Kivu y’amajyaruguru, gakomeje kwigarurirwa n’inyeshyamba zo muri Uganda zikunze gufata abagore ku ngufu.
She said in these situations women are considered victims, and are not implicated in the search for peace.	Avuga ko muri ibi bihe abagore bafatwa nkabahohotewe, kandi ntibagira uruhare mugushakisha amahoro.

Bihamba coordinates an organization called the Synergy of Women Against Sexual Violence.	Bihamba ahuza umuryango witwa Synergy y'abagore wo kurwanya ihohoterwa rishingiye ku gitsina.
Counselors with the group have been attacked and threatened because of their work. 	Abajyanama hamwe n'itsinda baratewe kandi babangamiwe n'ibikorwa byabo.
When Bihamba was at work one day, Congolese soldiers attacked her home, and sexually assaulted one of her daughters.	Umunsi umwe ubwo Bihamba yari ku kazi, abasirikari ba congo bateye iwe, basambanya umwe mu bakobwa be.
One of them, Justine Masika Bihamba, told a gathering of Washington, D.C., university students and concerned citizens that the area in which she works, Beni, in North Kivu province, is still overrun by Ugandan rebels who regularly rape women.	Bihamba yasobanuye ko igikenewe - ikiruta byose - ari amahoro mu burasirazuba bwa Kongo.
She said she believes sexual crimes would go down drastically if fighting stopped.	Yavuze ko yizera ko ibyaha by'ihohotera rishingiye ku gitsina bizagabanuka cyane imirwano iramutse ihagaze.
Activist Donatella Rostagno, from the European network for Central Africa, accompanied Bihamba on her trip to the United States.	Umurwanashyaka Donatella Rostagno, ukomoka mu ihuriro ry’iburayi rikorera muri Afurika yo hagati, yaherekeje Bihamba mu rugendo rwe muri Amerika.
She said she supports the work being done by the U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict.	Yavuze ko ashyigikiye imirimo ikorwa n’uhagarariye Umuryango w’abibumbye ushinzwe ihohoterwa rishingiye ku gitsina mu makimbirane.
Rostagno also said feels, however, the international community is not doing enough to stop Congo's war, despite having a large U.N. peacekeeping mission there.	Rostagno yavuze kandi ko abyumva, ariko ko, umuryango mpuzamahanga udakora ibishoboka byose ngo uhagarike intambara ya Congo, nubwo hariyo akazi katoroshye ku Muryango w'Abibumbye ko kubungabunga amahoro.
"""The majority of the actions is made to look at the consequences, to work with the women who are victims, but not enough is done to look at the causes of the rapes and the conflict,"" said Rostagno."	"Rostagno ati: ""Ibyinshi mu bikorwa bikorwa kugira ngo harebwe ingaruka, gukorana n'abagore bahohotewe, ariko ntibihagije kugira ngo harebwe ibitera gufata ku ngufu n'amakimbirane."""
Deteriorating situation amid global concern	Ibintu byifashe nabi kandi biteye impungenge isi
She fears the overall situation in eastern Congo is getting worse, not better - despite the international attention - with rebels, militias, and renegade soldiers still running rampant.	Afite ubwoba ko muri rusange mu burasirazuba bwa Kongo , ibintu bigenda birushaho kuba bibi - nubwo amahanga abitayeho - inyeshyamba, imitwe yitwara gisirikare, n'abasirikare bigometse bikomeje kwiyongera.
"""A lot of these rebel groups are getting reorganized, and are even getting in a coalition so the movements that we see in the region, it is worrying us,"" said Rostagno."	"Rostagno ati: ""Benshi muri iyo mitwe y'inyeshyamba barimo kongera kuvugururwa, ndetse bakinjira mu ihuriro bityo imitwe tubona mu karere, iraduhangayikishije."""
"""I think we were more optimistic on this region six months ago than today."	Ndatekereza ko twagize ibyiringiro muri kano karere amezi atandatu ashize kurusha uyu munsi.
"""The United Nations has identified three armed groups that gang raped dozens of people about two months ago in a week-long attack in Luvungi, another part of North Kivu province."	Umuryango w'abibumbye wagaragaje imitwe itatu yitwaje intwaro yasambanyije ku gahato abantu benshi mu gihe cy'amezi abiri ashize mu gitero cyabereye i Luvungi, mu kindi gice cy'intara ya Kivu y'Amajyaruguru.
Those implicated are the Mai Mai Cheka, the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda, and followers of an army deserter, Colonel Emmanuel Nsengiyumva.	Ababigizemo uruhare ni Mai Mai Cheka, Ingabo ziharanira Demokarasi yo Kwibohoza mu Rwanda, hamwe n'abayoboke b'umuntu watorotse ingabo, Colonel Emmanuel Nsengiyumva.
Proposals for improvementDuring their presentation, the two activists, Bihamba and Rostagno, also offered concrete proposals to make the situation better.	Ibyifuzo byo kunoza. Mu gihe cyo kwerekana uko byifashe, abaharanira inyungu bombi, Bihamba na Rostagno, na bo batanze ibyifuzo bifatika kugira ngo ibintu birusheho kuba byiza.
Rostagno explained that foreign non-governmental organizations get funding to tackle the issue of sexual violence, but local organizations often get ignored.	Rostagno yasobanuye ko imiryango itegamiye kuri Leta y’amahanga ibona inkunga yo gukemura ikibazo cy’ihohoterwa rishingiye ku gitsina, ariko imiryango y'aho ikunze kwirengagizwa.
She said complex applications to get outside funding favor bigger organizations.	Yavuze ko gusaba bigoye cyane kubona inkunga yo hanze y'imiryango minini.
"""They can just do it, they send it, they receive the money."	Bashobora kubikora, bakabyohereza, bakabona amafaranga.
"The problem is that the money in most cases is spent to pay for the fixed cost of the organization, for the salaries of expat people coming to the region and to the country, while the local non-governmental organizations, those working with the communities, with the women, with the children, in the villages, those who need need money to survive in order to do their work do not have access,"" said Rostagno. Bihamba said Congolese soldiers should be paid directly through bank withdrawals, rather than being paid through their superiors."	Ikibazo ni uko amafaranga menshi akoreshwa mu kwishyura ikiguzi cyagenwe cy'umuryango, ku mishahara y'inzobere ziza mu karere ndetse no mu gihugu, mu gihe imiryango itegamiye kuri leta yaho, ikorana n'abaturage, hamwe n'abagore n'abana, mu midugudu, abakeneye amafaranga kugira ngo babeho kugira ngo bakore akazi kabo ntibayabone ”, ibi bikaba byavuzwe na Rostagno. Bihamba yavuze ko abasirikare ba Kongo bakwiye guhembwa binyuze mu kubikuza mu mabanki, aho guhembwa binyuze ku bayobozi babo.
Bihamba said with the current system they receive only about a third of their salary, which causes some soldiers to loot and rape.	Bihamba yavuze ko hamwe n'uburyo buriho bahabwa gusa kimwe cya gatatu cy'umushahara wabo, bigatuma bamwe mu basirikare basahura no gufata ku ngufu.
She also called for an international tribunal for the Congo to help end general impunity, as well as more local tribunals for raped victims to seek justice. 	Yasabye kandi urukiko mpuzamahanga rwa Kongo kugira ngo rufashe guca burundu umuco wo kudahana muri rusange, ndetse n'inkiko nyinshi z’abafashwe ku ngufu kugira ngo barenganurwe.
In North Kivu, where more than 5 million people are estimated to live, she said there are only three tribunals.	Mu majyaruguru ya Kivu, aho bivugwa ko abantu barenga miliyoni 5 batuye, yavuze ko hari inkiko eshatu gusa.
Desmond Tutu Retires From Public Life	Desmond Tutu yasezeye mu buzima rusange.
Desmond Tutu fought apartheid in South Africa, and was critical of the war in Iraq.	Desmond Tutu yarwanyije ivangura muri Afurika y'Epfo, kandi yanenze intambara yo muri Iraki.
"""We waged a war that shouldn't have happened,"" he said.He also spoke out against genocide in Rwanda."	"Ati: ""Twakoze intambara itagomba kubaho"". Yavuze kandi ku kurwanya jenoside yakorewe mu Rwanda."
"""God have mercy on us,"" he said.The retired Anglican archbishop announced in July that he would retire from public life on his birthday."""	"Ati: ""Imana itugirire impuhwe."" Umwepiskopi mukuru wa Anglican uri mu kiruhuko cy'izabukuru yatangaje muri Nyakanga ko azasezera mu buzima rusange ku munsi w'amavuko."
"The time has come to slow down, and sip maybe rooibos tea with my beloved wife in the afternoons"" he said."	"Ati: ""Igihe kirageze cyo gutinda, kandi tunywa icyayi cya rooibos hamwe n'umugore wanjye nkunda nyuma ya saa sita""."
Tutu rose through the ranks of the Anglican church in South Africa to become the first black Anglican archbishop of Capetown.	Tutu yazamutse mu ntera mu itorero ry'Abangilikani muri Afurika y'Epfo aba umwepiskopi wa mbere w’abirabura wa Anglican wa Capetown.
He was a vocal critic of South Africa's white-ruled government and encouraged non-violence to end apartheid. 	Yamaganaga cyane guverinoma iyobowe n’abazungu kandi ashishikariza kurwanya ihohoterwa no kurangiza ivangura.
"Tutu was the recipient of many awards, and in 1984, he received a Nobel Peace Prize for advocating ""a democratic and just society without racial divisions."	"""Tutu ni we wahawe ibihembo byinshi, maze mu 1984, ahabwa igihembo cy’amahoro cyitiriwe Nobel kubera ko yashyigikiye ""sosiyete ishingiye kuri demokarasi kandi itabera idafite amacakubiri ashingiye ku moko."""
""" He used the recognition to step up the anti-apartheid campaign, calling for an economic boycott against South Africa. "	Yakoresheje uburyo bwo kumenyekanisha n'ingufu igikorwa cyo kurwanya ivanguramoko, asaba kwamagana ibangamirwa ry'ubukungu muri Afurika y'Epfo.
After the end of apartheid, Tutu called it an incredible day when Nelson Mandela won South Africa's first all-race elections.	Nyuma y'ivangura rya apartheid, Tutu yavuze ko ari umunsi udasanzwe ubwo Nelson Mandela yatsindaga amatora ya mbere yo muri Afurika y'Epfo.
"""I would say the highest point for me was when I stood on the balcony in 1994 to introduce our new, brand new president to South Africa and the world,"" he said."	"Ati: ""Navuga ko ingingo isumba izindi kuri njye ari igihe nahagararaga kuri ruhimbi mu 1994 kugira ngo menyekanishe perezida mushya, mushya muri Afurika y'Epfo no ku isi""."
To help mend the nation, President Mandela appointed Tutu as head of the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. 	Mu rwego rwo gufasha igihugu, Perezida Mandela yashyizeho Tutu nk'umuyobozi wa komisiyo ishinzwe ukuri n'ubwiyunge mu gihugu.
The group issued a report that included numerous confessions of guilt under apartheid in return for amnesty.	Itsinda ryasohoye raporo ikubiyemo kwatura ibyaha byinshi muri apartheid n'itangwa ry' imbabazi.
"""It makes specific proposals on how we can cultivate a culture of human rights and of structures to insure that the atrocities of the past will not reoccur,"" Tutu said.Tutu also campaigned to fight poverty and AIDS."	"Tutu yagize ati: ""Itanga ibitekerezo byihariye ku buryo dushobora kwimakaza umuco w'uburenganzira bwa muntu n'inzego kugira ngo twizere ko amarorerwa yo mu bihe byashize atazongera kubaho."""
In recent years, he expressed his disappointment in post-apartheid South Africa, especially the level of violent crime.	Mu myaka yashize, yagaragaje ko atishimiye muri Afurika y'Epfo nyuma ya apartheid, cyane cyane urwego rw'ibyaha by'urugomo.
Despite his withdrawal from public life, Tutu says he will continue to support his peace foundation and will remain part of a group of elder statesmen who campaign for peace and human rights.	N'ubwo yavuye mu buzima rusange, Tutu avuga ko azakomeza gushyigikira umusingi w’amahoro kandi ko azakomeza kuba mu itsinda ry’abasaza bakuru baharanira amahoro n’uburenganzira bwa muntu.
"But Tutu says he will no longer give interviews and, as he put it, will mostly ""shut up."""	"Ariko Tutu avuga ko atazongera gutanga ibiganiro kandi nk'uko yabivuze, ahanini ""azaceceka."""
"""I have been part of our struggle for freedom and democracy, and I am part of the celebration that we did succeed,"" he said. ""I have been part of the post apartheid dispensation and long for us to do infinitely better.""Many say his voice will be missed."	"Ati: ""Nagize uruhare mu rugamba rwo guharanira ubwisanzure na demokarasi, kandi ndi mu birori ko twatsinze"". Nagize uruhare mu ivangura rya apartheid kandi ndifuza ko dukora neza bitagira akagero. Benshi bavuga ko ijwi rye ritazabura."
Malawi's Jacaranda School for Orphans Celebrates Christmas	Ishuri Jacaranda rya Malawi ry’imfubyi ririzihiza Noheri
The management for the Jacaranda School for Orphans in Malawis commercial capital Blantyre recently hosted a party for its students as it closed for Christmas and New Years Day holidays.	Ubuyobozi bw'ishuri rya Jacaranda ry'impfubyi mu murwa mukuru w'ubucuruzi wa Malawis Blantyre riherutse gukora ibirori ku banyeshuri baryo kuko ryizihije iminsi mikuru ya Noheri n'Ubunani.
Around 500 people including students, staff members and others from surrounding areas attended the event, which was held at the schools premises in Chigumula area.	Abantu bagera kuri 500 barimo abanyeshuri, abakozi ndetse n’abandi baturutse mu turere tuhakikije bitabiriye ibirori byabereye mu bigo by’amashuri mu gace ka Chigumula.
"The party included gifts, Santa Claus, and a ""dancing show case"" by the students."	Muri ibyo birori harimo impano, Santa Claus n'imbyino by'abanyeshuri.
The school management told VOA that the yearly celebration has been a school tradition for the past 13years.	Ubuyobozi bw'ishuri bwatangarije VOA ko kwizihiza isabukuru buri mwaka byabaye umuco w'ishuri mumyaka 13 ishize.
"The school's director, Luc Deschamps, said: ""[We feel] it is very important for us to celebrate Christmas because the children do not have parents."	"Umuyobozi w'iryo shuri, Luc Deschamps, yagize ati: ""[Twumva] ari ngombwa kuri twe kwizihiza Noheri kuko abana badafite ababyeyi."
They stay with either a grandmother or a distant aunt or uncle, and they are not able to cerebrate at home or have a party or a little bit of sweets and cake for the children. 	Bagumana na nyirakuru, nyirasenge cyangwa nyirarume kandi ntibashobora guterana mu rugo cyangwa kugira ibirori cyangwa akantu gato karyoshye hamwe na keke ku bana.
"So, we provide a happy day for the children to celebrate the spirit of Christmas. And it is also a way of our children to learn to give."""	"Rero, dukora umunsi mwiza ku bana twizihiza Noheri. Kandi ni n'inzira yo gutuma abana bacu biiga gutanga. """
No media source currently available	Nta soko y'amakuru ubu ihari.
"Deschamps, who is also an Honorary Consul of France in Malawi, said before the main event the patrons were treated to ""a nice meal"" from the students."	"Deschamps, akaba kandi ari n'Umujyanama w’icyubahiro w’Ubufaransa muri Malawi, yavuze ko mbere y’ibirori nyamukuru abo bagenzuzi bahawe ""ifunguro ryiza"" n’abanyeshuri."
"""We had a big, big lunch with good meat and rice,[the dish made from maize flour called] nsima, of course, and vegetables. "	"Yagize ati: ""Twabonye ifunguro rya saa sita rihagije kandi rifite inyama n'umuceri mwiza, [ifunguro rikozwe mu ifu y'ibigori yitwa] nsima, ndetse n'imboga."
"And it was the students themselves who cooked the meal for everybody, for over 500 people,"" he said."	Kandi abanyeshuri ubwabo ni bo bariteguriye buri wese, ku bantu barenga 500.
"One of the students, Eddah Zimba, said, ""The celebrations are really cool, ... I have enjoyed myself. I have eaten, and now I am here dancing. "	"Umwe mu banyeshuri, Eddah Zimba, yagize ati: ""Ibirori ni byiza rwose, ... ubwange nishimye. Nariye, none ndimo no kubyina."
"What has interested me most is the gift that we have received the like the puffs, the biscuits, the squash and the dance."""	"Icyanshimishije cyane ni impano twahawe zirimo nk'ibi puffs, ibisuguti, amashu n'imbyino. """
She thanked the schools management for hosting the Christmas party for students who in most cases do not have such celebrations at home.	Yashimiye ubuyobozi bw'amashuri kuba bwaremeye gukora ibirori bya Noheri ku banyeshuri usanga akenshi badafite ibirori nk'ibi mu rugo.
Another student Emmanuel Chisale said good meal aside, the event has taught him the spirit of sharing.	Undi munyeshuri Emmanuel Chisale yavuze ifunguro ryiza ku ruhande rwe, ibirori byamwigishije umuco wo gusangira.
"""This party has brought a change in my life. I have learned that we have to have a heart for sharing one another as the Father Christmas was doing,"" he said."	"Ati: ""Ibi biroro byazanye impinduka mu buzima bwanjye. Namenye ko tugomba kugira umutima wo gusangira nk'uko Papa Noheri yabikoraga""."
Founded in 2002, the Jacaranda School for Orphans is the only one in Malawi which provides free primary, secondary and tertiary education to children without parents.	Ishuri ry'imfubyi rya Jacaranda ryashinzwe mu 2002, rikaba ari ryo ryonyine muri Malawi ritanga uburezi bw'amashuri abanza, ayisumbuye na kaminuza ku buntu ku bana badafite ababyeyi.
A Malawian woman, Marie Da Silva, started the school after she returned from the United States where she spent nineteen years working as a nanny.	Umugore wo muri Malawi, Marie Da Silva, yatangije ishuri nyuma yo kuva muri Amerika aho yari amaze imyaka cumi n'icyenda akora akazi ko kurera.
"""In 2022, it's really undeniable that media polarization and information chaos are really fueling social divisions in ways that are pretty new,"" said Clayton Weimers, deputy director of RSF for the United States, told VOA. "	"Umuyobozi wungirije wa RSF muri Leta Zunze ubumwe za Amerika, Clayton Weimers, yabwiye ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abanyamerika ati: ""Mu 2022, ntawahakana ko kuba itangazamakuru rikabije ndetse n'akajagari mu makuru bitera amacakubiri mu mibereho mu buryo bushya."""
He said the prevalence of partisan news around the world has come at the expense of authentic journalism.	Yavuze ko ubwamamare bw'amakuru y'amashyaka ku isi bwazanywe no gutangaza amakuru nyayo.
The group's annual report ranks 180 countries based on the environment for independent journalism. 	Raporo ngarukamwaka y'itsinda rishyira ku rutonde ibihugu 180 bishingiye ku itangazamakuru ryigenga.
This year, however, RSF said it used a new method that blends each country's political, legal, economic, sociocultural and security conditions.	Uyu mwaka ariko, RSF yavuze ko yakoresheje uburyo bushya buhuza buri gihugu mu buryo bwa politiki, amategeko, ubukungu, umuco ndetse n’umutekano.
"Now, the index classifies a record 28 countries as ""having very bad media freedom."" "	"Noneho, urutonde rwerekana ibihugu 28 ""bifite umudendezo mubi w'itangazamakuru."""
That group includes China, which is exporting censorship beyond its borders while also amplifying the Kremlin's propaganda on Russia's devastating war against Ukraine.	Iri tsinda ririmo Ubushinwa, bwohereza ibicuruzwa hanze y’umupaka ndetse bikanashimangira poropagande ya Kremle ku ntambara ibabaje y’Uburusiya na Ukraine.
Russia, China among worst	Uburusiya, Ubushinwa mu bibi cyane
"Since its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Russia has sought total control over news coverage, passing a new law that carries 15-year prison terms for reporting ""false news"" on the military, and even forbids calling the conflict a ""war."""	"Kuva igitero cyagabwa muri Ukraine ku ya 24 Gashyantare, Uburusiya bwashatse kugenzura amakuru yose, butora itegeko rishya rigena igifungo cy’imyaka 15 kubera itangazwa ""ry'amakuru y'ibinyoma"" ku gisirikare, ndetse rikabuza kuvuga ko amakimbirane ari ""intambara."""
That has forced most remaining independent news outlets, including the renowned Novaya Gazeta newspaper, Ekho Moskvy radio and Dozhd TV, to shut down or move outside Russia to continue operating.	Ibyo bikaba byaratumye ibitangazamakuru byinshi byigenga bisigaye, birimo ikinyamakuru kizwi cyane cya Novaya Gazeta, radiyo Ekho Moskvy na TV ya Dozhd, bihagarika cyangwa byimukira mu Burusiya kugira ngo bikomeze gukora.
With independent voices absent, experts say, the Russian government has been able to flood state-run airwaves with propaganda that downplays the war and spreads false or misleading justifications for the Kremlin's invasion.	Impuguke zivuga ko mu gihe amajwi yigenga adahari, guverinoma y’Uburusiya yashoboye gukwiza amakuru ya leta hamwe na poropagande yerekana intambara kandi ikwirakwiza impamvu z’ibinyoma cyangwa zibeshya ku gitero cya Kremle.
Russia's media repression stands at 155 out of 180 countries included in RSF's index, where one is the most free and 180 the least.	Ihohoterwa ry’itangazamakuru ry’Uburusiya rihagaze ku bihugu 155 mu bihugu 180 byashyizwe ku rutonde rwa RSF, aho kimwe ari cyo kiba gifite ubwisanzure kandi 180 bikaba bifite ubwisanzure buke.
"""It's safe to say at this point that the free press is a thing of the past in Russia,"" Clayton said."	"Clayton ati: ""Ni byiza kuvuga kuri ubu ko itangazamakuru ryigenga ari ikintu cyahise mu Burusiya."""
Throughout Russian President Vladimir Putin's 22 years in power, Moscow has been targeting journalists and the independent press, he said.	Yavuze ko mu myaka 22 Perezida w’Uburusiya Vladimir Putin amaze ku butegetsi, Moscou yibasiye abanyamakuru n’ibitangazamakuru byigenga.
"""But since the invasion of Ukraine, it seems that Putin has really finished off the independent media once and for all in Russia,"" Clayton said. ""At this point, it is impossible to accurately report on the war in Ukraine."""	"Clayton ati: ""Ariko kuva Ukraine yaterwa, birasa nkaho Putin yarangije itangazamakuru ryigenga rimwe na rimwe mu Burusiya."" Kugeza ubu, ntibishoboka gutanga raporo neza ku ntambara ibera muri Ukraine."
China ranked 175th in the new report. And now that it is firmly under Beijing's influence, Hong Kong also registered a dramatic decline, ranking 148th out of 180 following a lengthy series of raids and arrests that shuttered pro-democracy news sites.	Ubushinwa bwashyizwe ku mwanya wa 175 muri raporo nshya. Noneho, kubera ko iyobowe na Beijing, Hong Kong na yo yagabanutse ku buryo bugaragara, iza ku mwanya wa 148 kuri 180 nyuma y’igitero kinini n’ifatwa byafunze imbuga za interineti zishyigikira demokarasi.
"RSF's country file on China says it is the world's biggest jailer of journalists, with 120 in detention. The regime uses coercion, harassment, intimidation and surveillance to keep independent and foreign journalists from reporting on issues deemed ""sensitive."""	Idosiye ya RSF mu gihugu cy’Ubushinwa ivuga ko ari ho hari ifungwa ry’abanyamakuru benshi ku isi, 120 barafashwe. Ubutegetsi bukoresha agahato, gutotezwa, iterabwoba no kugenzura kugira ngo abanyamakuru bigenga ndetse n’abanyamahanga badatanga amakuru ku bibazo bifatwa nk’ibikomeye.
"""President Xi Jinping, in power since 2013, has restored a media culture worthy of the Maoist era, in which freely accessing information has become a crime and to provide information an even greater crime,"" RSF's country file states."	Perezida Xi Jinping, wagiye ku butegetsi kuva mu 2013, yagaruye umuco w'itangazamakuru ukwiye, mu gihe cya Maoist ho, aho kubona amakuru ku bwisanzure byabaye icyaha no gutanga amakuru bikaba icyaha gikomeye kurushaho.
Rising authoritarianism	Kwiyongera k'ubutegetsi bw'igitugu
North Korea remains the worst country in the rankings at 180th. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, political turmoil, conflict and rising authoritarianism have wiped out years of progress.	Koreya ya ruguru ikomeje kuba igihugu kibi ku rutonde kikaba icya 180. Ahandi hose mu karere ka Aziya-Pasifika, imvururu za politiki, amakimbirane hamwe n’ubutegetsi bw'igitugu byiyongereye byahanaguyeho iterambere.
The 2021 coup in Myanmar marked a 10-year setback for media rights, with journalists detained, media licenses revoked, and many news outlets returning to exile. 	Ihirikwa ry’ubutegetsi bwo mu 2021 muri Miyanimari ryagaragaje ko hasubijwe imyaka 10 uburenganzira bw’itangazamakuru, abanyamakuru barafungwa, impushya z’itangazamakuru zivanwaho, ndetse n’ibitangazamakuru byinshi bisubira mu buhungiro.
Under the military junta, Myanmar, ranking 176th, is one of the world's biggest jailers of journalists.	Ku butegetsi bwa gisirikare, Miyanimari iri ku mwanya wa 176, ni hamwe mu hafunze abanyamakuru bakomeye ku isi.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban insurgents pledged to uphold press freedom when they took power in August 2021.	Muri Afuganisitani, inyeshyamba z’abatalibani ziyemeje guharanira ubwisanzure bw’itangazamakuru igihe zabafatiye ku butegetsi muri Kanama 2021.
"Instead, RSF said the ""Taliban's seizure of power has further worsened conditions for reporters and news organizations, who are the targets of all forms of intimidation and violence."" Afghanistan ranked 154th."	"Nyamara, RSF yavuze ko ""kwigarurira ubutegetsi bw’abatalibani byarushijeho kuba bibi ku banyamakuru n’imiryango itangaza amakuru, bakaba ari bo bakorerwa iterabwoba n’urugomo."" Afuganisitani iri ku mwanya wa 154."
Across Africa, laws criminalizing online journalism have dealt a new blow to the right to information, RSF said, while the spread of rumors, propaganda, and disinformation has contributed to undermine access to quality information.	RSF yavuze ko hirya no hino muri Afurika, amategeko ahana itangazamakuru ku rubuga rwa interineti yagize ingaruka nshya ku burenganzira bwo kumenya amakuru, mu gihe ikwirakwizwa ry’ibihuha, poropagande, ndetse n’amakuru yanduye byagize uruhare mu guhungabanya amakuru meza.
In Ethiopia, the war in the Tigray region, with its communication blackouts and restricted access, were the main factors that placed the country 114 on the index. 	Muri Etiyopiya, intambara yo mu karere ka Tigray, hamwe n’itumanaho no kubuza kwinjirira amakuru, ni byo bintu nyamukuru byashyize igihugu ku rutonde rwa 114.
Neighboring Eritrea and Djibouti are far worse, ranking near the bottom at 179 and 164, respectively.	Abaturanyi ba Eritereya na Djibouti ho ni bibi cyane, biza hafi ya 179 na 164.
African media continue to struggle economically, RSF said it its accompanying analysis.	Ibitangazamakuru byo muri Afurika bikomeje guhangana mu by’ubukungu, RSF yavuze ko isesengura rihari riherekeje.
"""Despite a wave of liberalization in the 1990s, there are still, too often, cases of arbitrary censorship, especially on the internet, with occasional network shutdowns in some countries, arrests of journalists and violent attacks,"" the group said."	"Iri tsinda ryagize riti: ""Nubwo mu myaka ya za 90 habaye umudendezo wo kwishyira ukizana, haracyari, kenshi na kenshi, ibibazo byo kugenzura uko bishakiye, cyane cyane kuri interineti, rimwe na rimwe bifunga imiyoboro mu bihugu bimwe na bimwe, ifatwa ry'abanyamakuru ndetse n'ibitero by'urugomo."""
Clayton said the rising authoritarianism feeds on itself.	Clayton yavuze ko igitugu kigenda cyiyongera.
"""When we allow a culture of impunity to exist where authoritarians are allowed to go after journalists, harass them, arrest them, beat them in the streets and kill them, it has a knock-on effect,"" he said."	"Ati: ""Iyo twemeye ko umuco wo kudahana ubaho aho abategetsi b'igitugu bemerewe gukurikirana abanyamakuru, kubatoteza, kubafata, kubakubita mu mihanda no kubica, bigira ingaruka mbi""."
"""It emboldens that same authoritarian to do it again next time, and it emboldens other authoritarians who are watching to do the same."""	Irashimangira ubwo butegetsi bumwe bwo kuzongera kubikora ubutaha, kandi bugashimangira abandi bayobozi bareba ko babikora.
US not perfect	Amerika ntabwo Ari intunganye
"After a period of seeing its media attacked as ""fake news"" by former President Donald Trump, the United States retained a relatively high ranking of 42 in RSF's index. "	"Nyuma y'igihe kinini cyo kubona itangazamakuru ryacyo ryibasiwe ""n'amakuru y'ibinyoma"" n'uwahoze ari perezida Donald Trump, Amerika yagumanye umwanya wa 42 ukurikije urutonde rwa RSF."
That is largely thanks to the return of regular White House and federal agency press briefings.	Ibyo ahanini tubikesha kugaruka kwa White House bisanzwe hamwe n'abanyamakuru ba federasiyo.
"But RSF said problems persist, including ""the disappearance of local newspapers, the systematic polarization of the media, and the erosion of journalism by digital platforms amid a climate of animosity and aggression toward journalists, among others."""	"Ariko RSF yavuze ko ibibazo bikomeje, harimo ""ibura ry'ibinyamakuru byaho, itumanaho rya buri gihe ry'itangazamakuru, ndetse no gutsemba abanyamakuru ku mbuga za interineti mu gihe hari inzangano n'ibitero byibasiye abanyamakuru, n'ibindi."""
Barriers exist, for instance, when it comes to covering state governments and protests.	Inzitizi zirahari, nk'urugero, mu gihe cyo gusigasira inzego za leta n’imyigaragambyo.
"""We typically find that this is either due to just a blatant disregard for the laws governing open records or meetings, or they're simply misinterpreting them. "	"Umuyobozi mukuru w'ikigo cy'igihugu gishinzwe itangazamakuru, Beth Francesco ati: ""Ubusanzwe dusanga ibyo biterwa no kwirengagiza byimazeyo amategeko agenga inyandiko zifunguye cyangwa inama, cyangwa se bakabisobanura nabi."
"An individual is misinterpreting whether a journalist can be present at a particular event,"" said Beth Francesco, senior director of the National Press Club Journalism Institute."	"Umuntu ku giti cye arimo gusobanura nabi niba umunyamakuru ashobora kwitabira ibirori runaka."""
A few bright spots	Ahantu hakeye
Despite an overall trend of decline, Clayton said there are positives.	Nubwo muri rusange bigenda bigabanuka, Clayton yavuze ko hari ibyiza.
Some governments provide funding for news media without interfering in their operations, to ensure independence from political influence.	Guverinoma zimwe na zimwe zitanga inkunga mu bitangazamakuru zitivanze mu bikorwa byabyo, mu kugaragaza ubwigenge ko nta ruhare rwa politiki rurimo.
"""If you look at the top of our list, some of the things that stand out are these are countries that have robust public funding for media,"" he said, noting that ""it's always important to separate state funding for media and state-controlled media."""	"Ati: ""Iyo urebye hejuru y'urutonde rwacu, bimwe mu bigaragara ni ibi bihugu bifite inkunga ya Leta mu itangazamakuru"", akomeza agira ati: ""Buri gihe ni ngombwa gutandukanya inkunga ya Leta mu bitangazamakuru no kugenzurwa na leta."""
Three Scandinavian countries — Norway, Denmark and Sweden — respectively come at the top of RSF's index. Estonia, a former Soviet Union republic, ranked 4th.	Ibihugu bitatu bya Scandinaviya - Noruveje, Danemarke na Suwede - biza ku isonga ku rutonde rwa RSF. Esitoniya yahoze ari repubulika y’Abasoviyeti, iri ku mwanya wa 4.
RSF said the free exercise of journalism plays a major role in emerging democracies such as East Timor, ranked 17, Bhutan, ranked 33, and Mongolia, ranked 90.	RSF yavuze ko itangazamakuru rikorera mu bwisanzure rigira uruhare runini muri demokarasi igaragara nka Timoru y’iburasirazuba, iri ku mwanya wa 17, Bhutani, 33, na Mongoliya iri ku mwanya wa 90.
"East Timor was one country whose ranking skyrocketed, rising 54 places. But RSF cautioned that because of its change in methodology this year, ""care should be taken when comparing the 2022 rankings and scores with those from 2021."""	"Iburasirazuba bwa Timoru ni igihugu kimwe cyashyizwe hejuru cyane, kizamuka ahantu 54. Ariko RSF yibukije ko kubera ihinduka ry’imikorere muri uyu mwaka, ""hagomba kwitonderwa iyo ugereranije amanota 2022 n'amanota yo mu 2021."""

Al-Shabab Raids African Union Military Base	Al-Shabab yagabye igitero ku kigo cya gisirikare cy’ubumwe bwa Afurika
Al-Shabab fighters stormed an African Union military base in the village of El-Baraf in Somalias Middle Shabelle region early Tuesday, local officials and security sources say.	Abayobozi b'inzego z'ibanze ndetse n'abashinzwe umutekano bavuga ko abarwanyi ba Al-Shabab bateye mu birindiro by'ingabo z’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’Afurika mu mudugudu wa El-Baraf mu karere ka Somaliya Hagati mu karere ka Shabelle.
Officials told VOA Somali that the militants briefly seized the base before withdrawing from it. State media said Burundian solders at the base repulsed the attack.	Abayobozi babwiye VOA ikorera muri Somaliya ko abarwanashyaka bafashe ibirindiro mbere gato yo kubivamo. Ibitangazamakuru bya Leta byavuze ko abarwanyi bo mu Burundi bari mu kigo bashubije inyuma icyo gitero.
"""The Federal Government of Somalia condemns in the strongest possible terms the heinous attack targeting the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia forward operating base in Elbaraf, Middle Shabelle,"" the Somali Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted on its official Facebook page."	"Minisiteri y’ububanyi n’amahanga ya Somaliya yanditse ku rubuga rwayo rwa Facebook, igira iti: ""Guverinoma y’igihugu cya Somaliya iramagana mu magambo akomeye bishoboka ko igitero kibi cyagabwe ku butumwa bw’inzibacyuho bw’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’Afurika Yunze ubumwe muri Somaliya i Elbaraf, hagati ya Shabelle."""
"""We extend our deepest condolences to the victims of this terrorist attack and their families."""	Twihanganishije cyane abahuye n'ingaruka n'iki gitero cy'iterabwoba n'imiryango yabo.
The Mayor of El-Baraf, Abdullahi Haji Muhumed, said the militants started their attack with two suicide truck bombs. He said the militants then fought their way onto the base.	Umuyobozi w'akarere ka El-Baraf, Abdullahi Haji Muhumed, yavuze ko aba barwanyi batangiye kugaba ibitero bakoresheje bisasu bibiri by'amakamyo. Yavuze ko abarwanashyaka bahise barwanira mu birindiro.
Al-Shabab claimed the killing of 173 African Union forces. The group also claimed responsibility for capturing AU forces as prisoners-of-war. Both claims could not be independently verified. AU force headquarters and Somali military officials could not be immediately reached for comment.	Al-Shabab yatangaje ko hapfuye ingabo 173 z’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’Afurika. Uyu mutwe kandi wavuze ko ufite inshingano zo gufata ingabo za AU nk'imfungwa z'intambara. Ibyo birego byombi ntibishobora kugenzurwa mu bwigenge. Icyicaro gikuru cy’ingabo za AU hamwe n’abayobozi b’igisirikare cya Somaliya ntibashoboye guhita batanga ibisobanuro.
"In an interview with VOA, Muhumed, who was not at the village at the time of the attack, said he was told there were ""many deaths"" among Burundian forces but could not give an exact figure."	"Mu kiganiro yagiranye na VOA, Muhumed, utari mu mudugudu igihe igitero cyagabwaga, yavuze ko yabwiwe ko hari ""imfu nyinshi"" mu ngabo z’Uburundi ariko ko adashobora gutanga imibare nyayo."
"""Fighting like this never happened in this area,"" he said. ""It was heavy fighting."""	"Ati: ""Imirwano nk'iyi ntabwo yigeze ibera muri kariya gace"". Yari imirwano ikomeye."
He said two civilians were also killed and more than 10 others injured.	Yavuze ko abasivili babiri na bo bishwe abandi barenga 10 barakomereka.
Muhumed confirmed to VOA that al-Shabab militants withdrew from the base. He also reported airstrikes targeting the militants as they left the base but did not say who was responsible for the strikes.	Muhumed yemeje VOA ko abarwanyi ba al-Shabab bavuye mu birindiro. Yavuze kandi ko ibitero by’indege byibasiye abarwanashyaka ubwo bavaga mu birindiro ariko ntiyavuze uwagize uruhare muri ibyo bitero.
El-Baraf, approximately 150 kilometers north of Mogadishu, is one of the forward operating bases of African Union forces from Burundi.	El-Baraf, nko mu birometero 150 mu majyaruguru ya Mogadishu, ni kimwe mu birindiro by'ingabo z’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi ziba mu Burundi.
The incident marked the first major al-Shabab attack on AU forces since the mission changed its name and operational structures last month.	Iki cyabaye igitero cya mbere gikomeye al-Shabab yagabye ku ngabo za AU kuva ubwo butumwa bwahinduye izina n'imikorere yabyo mu kwezi gushize.
The U.N. Security Council, which authorized the new mission called the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), gives it a mandate to reduce the threat posed by al-Shabab, support the capacity-building of Somali security forces, and conduct a phased handover of security responsibilities to Somalia. The mission has until the end of 2024 to operate in the country.	Akanama k'umuryango w’abibumbye gashinzwe umutekano, kemereye ubutumwa bushya bwitwa Mission Union Transition Mission muri Somaliya (ATMIS), giha inshingano yo kugabanya iterabwoba ryatewe na al-Shabab, gushyigikira kongerera ubushobozi inzego z’umutekano za Somaliya. Hakozwe kandi ihererekanyabubasha ry’umutekano muri Somaliya. Inshingano ifite kugeza mu mpera za 2024 gukorera mu gihugu.
India’s Muslims Mark Eid al-Fitr Amid Community Violence	Abayisilamu bo mu Buhinde bagize Eid al-Fitr mu gihe cy’ihohoterwa ry’abaturage
Muslims across India marked Eid al-Fitr on Tuesday by offering prayers outside mosques, even as the celebrations this year came in the backdrop of a series of recent attacks against the community during the month of Ramadan.	Ku wa kabiri, Abayisilamu bo mu Buhinde bizihije umunsi mukuru wa Eid al-Fitr basengera hanze y’imisigiti, nubwo kwizihiza uyu mwaka byaje nyuma y’ibitero byibasiye abaturage mu kwezi kwa Ramadhan.
"""We will not have the same kind of festivity"" this time, said Mohammad Habeeb ur Rehman, a civil engineer in Indias financial capital, Mumbai. ""This is the most painful Eid with worst memories for Indian Muslims."""	"Mohammad Habeeb ur Rehman, umushakashatsi mu by'ubwubatsi mu murwa mukuru w'imari wa Indias, Mumbai, yagize ati: ""Ntabwo tuzagira ibirori nk'ibyo."" Uyu ni umunsi ukomeye ubabaza cyane twibuka abayisilamu bo mu Buhinde."
Anti-Muslim sentiment and attacks have surged across the country in the last month, including stone throwing between Hindu and Muslim groups during religious processions and subsequent demolitions of a number of properties mostly belonging to Muslims by authorities.	Mu kwezi gushize imyumvire yo kurwanya abayisilamu n'ibitero byagaragaye hirya no hino mu gihugu, harimo gutera amabuye hagati y'amatsinda y'abahindu n'abayisilamu mu gihe cy'imyigaragambyo y'idini ndetse no gusenya imitungo myinshi ahanini yari iy'abayisilamu n'abayobozi.
The community, which makes up 14% of Indias 1.4 billion population, is reeling from vilification by hard-line Hindu nationalists who have long espoused an anti-Muslim stance. Some leaders of Indias ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have tacitly supported the violence, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far been silent about it. Eid al-Fitr is typically marked with communal prayers, celebratory gatherings around festive meals and new clothes, but celebrations in India for the past two years have been marred by COVID-19 restrictions.	Uyu muryango ugizwe na 14% by'abaturage ba Indias miliyari 1.4, bahangayikishijwe no gutukwa n’abenegihugu b’Abahindu bakomeye kuva kera bashyigikiye imyigaragambyo yo kurwanya Abayisilamu. Bamwe mu bayobozi b’ishyaka riri ku butegetsi ry’Abahindu baharanira inyungu z’Abahindu bashyigikiye byimazeyo ihohoterwa, mu gihe Minisitiri w’intebe Narendra Modi kugeza ubu acecetse. Ubusanzwe Eid al-Fitr irangwa n'amasengesho rusange, guterana kwizihiza amafunguro y'iminsi mikuru hamwe n'imyenda mishya, ariko ibirori mu Buhinde mu myaka ibiri ishize byarangijwe na COVID-19.
In Indian-controlled Kashmir, the Muslim festival has been subdued for the past three years because of an unprecedented military lockdown after India stripped the regions semi-autonomy in 2019, followed by the pandemic. The region also saw a rise in violence during Ramadan, with at least 20 militants, two civilians and five police and soldiers killed.	Mu mujyi wa Kashmir ugenzurwa n’Ubuhinde, iserukiramuco ry’abayisilamu rimaze imyaka itatu ryigaruriwe n’igitero kitigeze kibaho nyuma y’uko Ubuhinde bwambuye uturere igice cyigenga muri 2019, hagakurikiraho icyorezo. Muri ako karere kandi hagaragaye urugomo muri Ramazani, hapfa nibura abarwanyi 20, abasivili babiri n'abapolisi n'abasirikare batanu.
"""As we prepare to celebrate Eid, a strong sense of collective loss jars at us,"" said Bashir Ahmed, a businessman in Srinagar."	"Umucuruzi muri Srinagar, Bashir Ahmed yagize ati: ""Mu gihe twitegura kwizihiza umunsi mukuru wa Eid, twumva ko ari ibibindi byuzuye igihombo kuri twe."""
Kashmir is the Muslim-majority disputed region where a violent insurgency against Indian rule and New Delhis brutal crackdown has raged for over three decades. Tens of thousands of people have died in the conflict.	Kashmir ni agace kagizwe n’abayisilamu aho usanga inyeshyamba zikaze ku butegetsi bw’Ubuhinde ndetse n’igitero simusiga cya New Delhis kimaze imyaka isaga mirongo itatu. Abantu ibihumbi mirongo bapfiriye muri iyo ntambara.
Meanwhile in the capital, New Delhi, hundreds assembled in the Jama Masjid, one of Indias largest mosques, while offering Eid prayers there for the first time in over two years due to pandemic restrictions. Families came together early on Tuesday morning while many people shared hugs and wishes.	Hagati aho, mu murwa mukuru, New Delhi, abantu babarirwa mu magana bateraniye i Jama Masjid, umwe mu misigiti minini ya Indias, mu gihe basengaga umunsi mukuru wa Noheri ku nshuro yabo ya mbere mu myaka irenga ibiri kubera inzitizi z’ibyorezo. Imiryango yateraniye kare mugitondo cyo kuwa kabiri mugihe abantu benshi basangiye guhobera no kwifuriza.
Beijing Residents Brace for COVID-19 Lockdown	Abatuye Beijing bitegura Gumamurugo kubera COVID-19
Unlike Shanghai, Beijing has yet to require that all its residents remain at home to contain the spread of COVID-19. Nevertheless, many people in its Chaoyang district and elsewhere are preparing for that possibility.	Bitandukanye na Shanghai, Beijing ntisaba ko abaturage bayo bose baguma mu rugo kugira ngo birinde COVID-19. Nubwo bimeze bityo ariko, abantu benshi mu karere kayo ka Chaoyang n'ahandi barimo kwitegura ku buryo bushoboka.
On Wednesday, city officials closed 60 subway stations, more than 10% of Beijing's vast system. They did not say when service would be resumed, according to ABC News.	Ku wa gatatu, abayobozi b'umugi bafunze gari ya moshi 60, zirenga 10% bya sisitemu ngari ya Beijing. Ntibavuze igihe serivisi izasubukurirwa nk'uko ABC News ibitangaza.
Beijing, a city of 21 million people, has been on high alert for the spread of COVID-19, as restaurants and bars pivot to takeout, gyms close and schools suspend classes indefinitely, according to CNBC.	Nk’uko CNBC ibitangaza, umujyi wa Beijing, umujyi utuwe na miliyoni 21, wakomeje kuba maso kugira ngo COVID-19 ikwirakwizwe, kubera ko amaresitora n'utubari bikurwaho, siporo zirafunga ndetse n'amashuri ahagarika amasomo mu gihe kitazwi.
"People who live in ""controlled"" areas, neighborhoods where cases have been discovered, have been told to stay in the city, and all residents must test for the virus three times throughout the week, according to ABC."	"Nk’uko ABC ibitangaza, abantu baba mu duce ""tugenzurwa"", mu duce twagaragayemo ibibazo, basabwe kuguma mu mujyi, kandi abaturage bose bagomba kwipimisha virusi mu cyumweru cyose."
Chinese authorities reported 5,489 cases nationwide on Wednesday, of which 4,982 were in Shanghai, which has been under a draconian lockdown for weeks.	Ku wa gatatu, abategetsi b'Abashinwa bavuze ko abantu 5489 mu gihugu hose, muri bo 4982 bari i Shanghai, bamaze ibyumweru byinshi bifunzwe.
Beijing reported 46 symptomatic cases and five asymptomatic on Wednesday. The city's total since April 22, what it considers the start of its omicron outbreak, is 544.	Ku wa gatatu, Pekin yatangaje ibibazo 46 by'ibimenyetso na bitanu bidafite ibimenyetso. Umujyi wose kuva 22 Mata, icyo ubona ko ari intangiriro yicyorezo cyawo, ni 544.
Mr. Zhang, a Beijing resident, said he had bought extra food and water, even though he doesn't think Beijing will be locked down like Shanghai. He asked that VOA not use his full name because he was afraid of attracting official attention.	Bwana Zhang utuye i Beijing, yavuze ko yaguze ibiryo n'amazi by'inyongera, nubwo adatekereza ko Beijing izafungwa nka Shanghai. Yasabye ko VOA idakoresha izina rye ryuzuye kuko yatinyaga gukurura abayobozi.
"""I have six bags of rice, two bags of noodles, and several boxes of water, instant noodles and (nutritionally dense) biscuits, and I haven't stocked up too much,"" Zhang told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview last week. He said he bought his groceries online because the supermarket was crowded."	"Mu cyumweru gishize, Zhang yatangarije VOA Mandarin ati: ""Mfite imifuka itandatu y'umuceri, imifuka ibiri ya noode, hamwe n'amasanduku menshi y'amazi, isafuriya ihita hamwe na biscuits (byuzuye intungamubiri), kandi sinigeze mbika byinshi"".Yavuze ko yaguze ibyo kurya kuri interineti kubera ko supermarket yari yuzuye."
Ms. Yao, who lives in the Chaoyang district, told VOA Mandarin that she had been stocking up on necessities since the beginning of this year, after the Ministry of Commerce recommended that everyone do so. She asked that VOA Mandarin not use her full name because she wanted to avoid official retribution.	Madamu Yao utuye mu karere ka Chaoyang, yatangarije VOA Mandarin ko yabitse ibikenerwa kuva mu ntangiriro z'uyu mwaka, nyuma y'uko Minisiteri y'Ubucuruzi ibasabye ko buri wese yabikora. Yasabye ko VOA Mandarin idakoresha izina rye ryuzuye kuko yashakaga kwirinda ibihano byemewe.
"""I have always maintained a good habit of reserving food. So I have a lot of rice, noodles and oil at home,"" she said, adding that she figured her family would be fine even if Beijing locked down for a month."	"Ati: ""Nahoraga ngira akamenyero keza ko kubika ibiryo. Mfite rero umuceri, isafuriya n'amavuta mu rugo"", akomeza avuga ko yasanze umuryango we uzaba mwiza nubwo Beijing yafunzwe ukwezi."
And while Beijing has not yet closed the city, citizens' lives have been disrupted.	Mu gihe kandi Beijing itarafunga umujyi, ubuzima bw’abaturage bwahurangabanye.
On April 28, the Beijing Chaoyang District Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital issued a notice that the outpatient and emergency departments of the hospital would suspend the admission of patients.	Ku ya 28 Mata, ibitaro byita ku buzima bw’ababyeyi n’abana bo mu karere ka Beijing Chaoyang byasohoye itangazo rivuga ko ishami ry’ibitaro n’ubutabazi by’ibitaro bizahagarika kwakira abarwayi.
On the same day, Chaoyang Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in Beijing, announced on its official Weibo account that its emergency department would also suspend the admission of patients. Weibo is China's equivalent of Twitter.	Kuri uwo munsi, ibitaro bya Chaoyang, kimwe mu bitaro binini i Beijing, byatangaje ku rubuga rwayo rwa Weibo ko ishami ryihutirwa naryo rizahagarika kwakira abarwayi. Weibo nu Bushinwa bungana na Twitter.
"Angry Chinese netizens left more than 800 messages under the official WeChat account ""Beijing Headline."""	"Abashinwa bafite umujinya mwinshi basize ubutumwa burenga 800 munsi ya konte ya WeChat ""Umutwe wa Beijing."""
"""Why do you stop the emergency room as soon as there is a new COVID case, and how many people will be killed due to the secondary disaster caused by the COVID?"" a netizen asked in a Weibo post."	"""Kuki uhagarika icyumba cyihutirwa ukimara kubona ikibazo gishya cya COVID, kandi ni bangahe bazahitanwa n’impanuka ya kabiri yatewe na COVID?"" umu netisen yabajije mu nyandiko ya Weibo."
Some Beijing residents said they were not worried about a Shanghai-like lockdown.	Bamwe mu baturage ba Beijing bavuze ko badahangayikishijwe no gufunga nka Shanghai.
"""Basically, I'm not afraid,"" said Mr. Wang, who asked VOA Mandarin to not use his full name so he could avoid attracting authorities' attention. ""The party, government and military are here, and the people are here."""	"Bwana Wang wasabye VOA Mandarin kudakoresha izina rye ryuzuye kugira ngo yirinde gukurura abayobozi. Ati: ""Muri rusange, ntabwo ntinya."" Ishyaka, guverinoma n'abasirikare bari hano, kandi abaturage bari hano."
However, Wang told VOA Mandarin, in mid-October last year, after one person in his apartment building was diagnosed as positive, about 600 people from more than 200 families were forced into isolation at several hotels in the Changping district for 21 days.	Icyakora, Wang yabwiye VOA Mandarin, ko hagati mu Kwakira umwaka ushize, nyuma yuko basanze umuntu umwe mu nyubako ye afite icyiza, abantu bagera kuri 600 bo mu miryango irenga 200 bahatiwe kwigunga mu mahoteri menshi yo mu karere ka Changping mu gihe cy'iminsi 21.
Wang and his wife were not allowed to share a room at their hotel.	Wang n'umugore we ntibari bemerewe gusangira icyumba muri hoteri yabo.
What particularly puzzled and annoyed Wang was that on the last day of the mandatory hotel quarantine, in addition to routine nasal and oral swabs during testing, authorities added anal swabs to the regimen.	Icyatangaje cyane kandi cyarakaje Wang ni uko ku munsi wanyuma wa karantine ya hoteri iteganijwe, usibye kwizuru ryamazuru hamwe n'umunwa mu gihe cyo kwipimisha, abayobozi bongeyeho anal kuri rejime.

The World Health Organization said Wednesday that the number of newly reported coronavirus cases and deaths globally continued to fall in the last week, continuing a decline that began in March.	Ku wa gatatu, Ishami ry'Umuryango w'Abibumbye ryita ku Buzima ryatangaje ko umubare w'abantu banduye coronavirus n'impfu zavuzwe ku isi wakomeje kugabanuka mu cyumweru gishize, bikomeza kugabanuka byatangiye muri Werurwe.
In its weekly report on the pandemic, the U.N. health agency said there were about 3.8 million new infections and more than 15,000 deaths last week, a 17% and 3% drop on the week respectively. But those figures are believed to be a significant underestimate of COVID-19's true toll as increasing numbers of countries abandon widespread testing and surveillance.	Muri raporo y’icyumweru ivuga ku cyorezo, ikigo cy’ubuzima cya Leta zunze ubumwe z’Amerika cyavuze ko mu cyumweru gishize hari abantu bashya bagera kuri miliyoni 3.8 n’impfu zirenga 15.000, icyumweru 17% na 3% bikagabanuka. Ariko iyo mibare ngo ni ugusuzugura cyane umubare wa COVID-19 kuko umubare w’ibihugu ugenda ureka kwipimisha no kugenzura.
Still, WHO noted that cases rose by about a third in Africa and 13% in the Americas. There was also a nearly 70% jump in deaths reported in India, although that was attributed to delayed reporting rather than a recent surge of disease.	Ninde, OMS yavuze ko imanza ziyongereyeho kimwe cya gatatu muri Afurika na 13% muri Amerika. Habayeho kandi gusimbuka hafi 70% by'impfu zavuzwe mu Buhinde, nubwo ibyo byatewe no gutinda gutanga raporo aho kuba indwara ziherutse kwiyongera.
Last week, authorities in South Africa said they had noted an uptick in COVID-19 cases attributable to the BA.4 mutant of omicron, although they said it was too early to tell if that would result in a significant new wave of disease. Although the BA.4 version of COVID-19's omicron variant appears more infectious than omicron, WHO said there was no evidence yet that it was leading to substantially higher rates of hospitalization or death.	Mu cyumweru gishize, abategetsi bo muri Afurika yepfo bavuze ko babonye ikibazo cya COVID-19 cyatewe na BA.4 mutant ya omicron, nubwo bavuze ko hakiri kare kumenya niba ibyo byavamo indwara nshya. Nubwo verisiyo ya BA.4 ya COVID-19 ya omicron isa nkaho yanduye kurusha omicron, OMS yavuze ko nta kimenyetso cyerekana ko biganisha ku mubare munini w’ibitaro cyangwa urupfu.
"Salim Abdool Karim, a public health expert at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said that while only a ""modest"" rise in cases had been noted, South Africa was also in the middle of a holiday period and testing had dropped significantly. He said the cases were slowing and were ""not following a rocket-like upward trajectory we would expect"" in another spike of disease."	"Salim Abdool Karim, impuguke mu buzima rusange muri kaminuza ya KwaZulu-Natal, yavuze ko mu gihe hagaragaye ubwiyongere bukabije mu manza, Afurika yepfo nayo yari mu kiruhuko kandi ikizamini cyaragabanutse cyane. Yavuze ko imanza zidindiza kandi ko ""zidakurikiza inzira ya roketi imeze nk'izamuka hejuru""."
At a press briefing on Wednesday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said it was too soon to tell if COVID-19 was entering a seasonal pattern and warned against countries dropping all of their restrictions too quickly — as many in the West have done.	Ku wa gatatu, mu kiganiro n'abanyamakuru, umuyobozi mukuru w’ibihe bidasanzwe muri OMS, Dr. Michael Ryan, yavuze ko bidatinze kumenya niba COVID-19 yinjiye mu bihe by’ibihe kandi akanaburira ibihugu kureka ibyo bibuza byose - nk'uko benshi mu Burengerazuba babikoze.
"""The jury is still out as to how seasonal this virus will become,"" he said, explaining that it wasn't proven yet that COVID-19 would naturally drop off in the summer and that the world could yet face more unsettling variants. ""If people are crowded together in conditions where a new variant is spreading, you will see high levels of transmission,"" he said."	"Ati: ""Inteko y'abacamanza iracyareba uko iyi virusi izagenda iba ibihe"", asobanura ko bitaragaragaye neza ko COVID-19 izagwa mu mpeshyi kandi ko isi ishobora guhura n'ibindi bintu bitesha umutwe. Ati: ""Niba abantu bateraniye hamwe mu bihe aho usanga ubundi buryo bushya bukwirakwira, uzabona ubwinshi bwo kwandura."""
Meanwhile in China, authorities continued to crack down on cities, including Beijing, where more than 10% of the subway system was shut down in an effort to curb the virus' spread, after authorities in the capital already closed down indoor dining, gyms and school classes.	Hagati aho, mu Bushinwa, abayobozi bakomeje guhashya imijyi, harimo na Beijing, aho abantu barenga 10% bya sisitemu ya metero zafunzwe mu rwego rwo gukumira virusi ikwirakwizwa, nyuma y’uko abayobozi mu murwa mukuru bamaze gufunga ibyokurya byo mu ngo, siporo ndetse amasomo y'ishuri.
In Shanghai, rigid and widely derided restrictions have led to shortages of food and medical aid along with a wider — though likely temporary — impact on the national economy. Desperate, outraged citizens have confronted authorities at barricades and online, screamed out of their windows and banged pots and pans in a sign of frustration and anger.	Muri Shanghai, imbogamizi zikomeye kandi zisebya abantu benshi zatumye ibura ry'ibiribwa n'inkunga z'ubuvuzi hamwe n’ingaruka nini nubwo zishobora kuba iz'igihe gito - ku bukungu bw'igihugu. Abaturage bihebye, bararakaye bahanganye n'abayobozi kuri bariyeri no kuri interineti, bavuza induru bava mu madirishya maze bakubita inkono n'amasafuriya mu rwego rwo kwiheba n'uburakari.
Myanmar Supreme Court Rejects Aung San Suu Kyi Appeal on Corruption Charges	Urukiko rw'Ikirenga rwa Miyanimari rwanze ubujurire bwa Aung San Suu Kyi ku byaha aregwa bya ruswa
An appeal of a five-year jail sentence against ousted Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi was rejected Wednesday by the country's supreme court.	Ku wa gatatu, urukiko rw’ikirenga rw’igihugu rwanze ubujurire bw’igifungo cy’imyaka 5 ku muyobozi wa Miyanimari wirukanwe Aung San Suu Kyi.
The decision reportedly came as soon as the claim for an appeal was lodged, and the court didn't entertain arguments from either side in the case.	Iki cyemezo ngo cyafashwe akimara gutanga ikirego mu bujurire, kandi urukiko ntirwakiriye impaka ku mpande zombi muri uru rubanza.
Suu Kyi, 76, was sentenced last week after being found guilty of 11 counts of corruption, including taking a bribe of cash and gold bars worth $600,000.	Mu cyumweru gishize, Suu Kyi, yakatiwe nyuma yo guhamwa n'ibyaha 11 bya ruswa, birimo gufata ruswa y'amafaranga n'utubari twa zahabu bifite agaciro ka $ 600,000.
Her lawyer called the charge absurd.	Umwunganizi we yavuze ko ikirego kitumvikana.
Suu Kyi had already been sentenced to six years for actions against the military, breaking COVID-19 rules and breaking a telecommunications law.	Suu Kyi yari amaze gukatirwa imyaka itandatu kubera ibikorwa byo kurwanya igisirikare, kurenga ku mategeko ya COVID-19 no kurenga ku itegeko ry'itumanaho.
She faces many more charges, and if found guilty could be sentenced to more than 150 years in jail.	Akurikiranyweho ibindi byaha byinshi, kandi aramutse ahamwe n'icyaha ashobora gukatirwa imyaka irenga 150.
Suu Kyi has been under house arrest since a military coup took over the country last year.	Suu Kyi afungiye mu rugo kuva ihirikwa ry’abasirikare ryigarurira igihugu umwaka ushize.
Since the coup, on Feb. 1, 2021, there have been widespread protests against the military regime. The regime cracked down violently in many cases, leaving more than 1,800 civilians dead and more than 10,000 arrested, charged or sentenced, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma).	Kuva ihirikwa ry’ubutegetsi, ku ya 1 Gashyantare 2021, habaye imyigaragambyo yo kwamagana ubutegetsi bwa gisirikare. Ishyirahamwe rifasha imfungwa za politiki (Birimaniya) rivuga ko ubwo butegetsi bwahagurukiye mu buryo bwinshi, hasigara abasivili barenga 1.800 abandi barenga 10,000 batawe muri yombi, bakurikiranyweho cyangwa bakatirwa.

Report: Iran to Execute Swedish-Iranian National by May 21	Raporo: Irani izica igihugu cya Suwede-Irani bitarenze ku ya 21 Gicurasi
Iran will later this month execute a Swedish-Iranian national whom it has imprisoned since 2016 and convicted of spying for Israel, media reported.	Ibitangazamakuru byatangaje ko Irani mu mpera z'uku kwezi izica umunyagihugu wa Suwede na Irani yafunzwe kuva mu 2016 kandi ahamwa n'icyaha cyo kuneka Isiraheli.
Irans semiofficial ISNA news agency on Wednesday released a report in which Iranian officials stated that Tehran will implement the death penalty against Ahmad Reza Jalali by May 21.	Kuri uyu wa gatatu, ibiro ntaramakuru ISNA bitanga amakuru kuri Irans byatangaje raporo aho abayobozi ba Irani bavuze ko Tehran izashyira mu bikorwa igihano cy'urupfu kuri Ahmad Reza Jalali bitarenze ku ya 21 Gicurasi.
Jalali, a researcher and physician who specializes in disaster relief, was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016. In 2017, Jalali was sentenced to death in Iran after he had been found guilty of passing information about two Iranian nuclear scientists to Israel to help it assassinate several nuclear scientists.	Jalali, umushakashatsi n’umuganga w’inzobere mu gutabara ibiza, yatawe muri yombi ubwo yari mu ruzinduko muri Irani muri Mata 2016. Muri 2017, Jalali yakatiwe urwo gupfa muri Irani nyuma yo guhamwa n’icyaha cyo kugeza amakuru kuri siyansi ebyiri za Irani muri Isiraheli fasha guhitana abahanga benshi ba kirimbuzi.
Rights groups have condemned Jalalis detention, citing Irans pattern of detaining dual nationals and expatriates without due process.	Imiryango iharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu yamaganye ifungwa rya Jalalis, ivuga ko Irans yo gufunga abenegihugu bombi ndetse n’ababa mu mahanga nta nzira iboneye.
Iran does not recognize dual nationals.	Irani ntiyemera abenegihugu babiri.
The announcement came as authorities in Stockholm wrapped up the trial of Hamid Nouri, a former Iranian prosecution official whom Swedish officials arrested in November 2019.	Ibi byatangajwe mu gihe abayobozi i Stockholm bashoje urubanza rwa Hamid Nouri wahoze ari umushinjacyaha wa Irani, abayobozi ba Suwede bata muri yombi mu Gushyingo 2019.
Authorities say Nouri played a role in the deaths of political prisoners executed on Iranian government orders at Irans Gohardasht prison during the final phase of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. Nouri has been held in custody in Sweden since his arrest.	Abayobozi bavuga ko Nouri yagize uruhare mu rupfu rw’imfungwa za politiki ziciwe ku itegeko rya guverinoma ya Irani muri gereza ya Irans Gohardasht mu cyiciro cya nyuma cy’intambara ya Irani na Iraki mu 1988. Nouri afungiye muri Suwede kuva yatabwa muri yombi.
On Wednesday, the final day of Nouri's trial, a Stockholm district court judge set the date of the verdict for July 14.	Ku wa gatatu, umunsi wa nyuma w’urubanza rwa Nouri, umucamanza w’urukiko rw’intara ya Stockholm yashyizeho itariki y’urubanza ku ya 14 Nyakanga.
Amnesty International put the number of those executed at the prison at 5,000 but said in a 2018 report that the number could be higher.	Amnesty International yashyize ahagaragara umubare w'abiciwe muri gereza ku 5.000 ariko muri raporo ya 2018 ivuga ko umubare ushobora kuba mwinshi.
"Human Rights Watch, in a recent report, said, ""Iran continues to be one of the worlds leading implementers of the death penalty."""	"Human Rights Watch, muri raporo iherutse, yagize ati: ""Irani ikomeje kuba umwe mu isi iyobora abashyira mu bikorwa igihano cy'urupfu."""
If Nouri is convicted, he will face a maximum life sentence on charges of international war crimes and human rights abuses. Iran recently summoned the Swedish envoy in protest over Nouris case.	Nouri aramutse ahamwe n'icyaha, azahanishwa igifungo cya burundu ashinjwa ibyaha mpuzamahanga by'intambara no guhonyora uburenganzira bwa muntu. Irani iherutse guhamagara intumwa ya Suwede mu rwego rwo kwamagana ikibazo cya Nouris.
Maja Aberg, senior policy adviser with Amnesty International Sweden, says it is no coincidence that Iran announced Jalalis pending execution just after Swedish prosecutors moved on Nouris trial.	Maja Aberg, umujyanama mukuru muri politiki muri Amnesty International Suwede, avuga ko bidahwitse ko Irani yatangaje Jalalis mu gihe hagitegerejwe kwicwa nyuma yuko abashinjacyaha ba Suwede bimukiye mu rubanza rwa Nouris.
"""It indicates that (Iran) sees him as a kind of piece in the jigsaw puzzle, which is very worrying,"" Aberg told Sweden's TT news agency."	"Aberg yatangarije ibiro ntaramakuru TT byo muri Suwede ati: ""Byerekana ko (Irani) imubona nk'igice cyo mu gihirahiro, biteye impungenge cyane."""
Swedish law allows for the prosecution of Swedish citizens and other nationals for crimes against international law committed abroad.	Amategeko ya Suwede yemerera gukurikirana abenegihugu ba Suwede n’abandi baturage ku byaha byibasiye amategeko mpuzamahanga akorerwa mu mahanga.

Erdogan Goes to Riyadh to Seal Rapprochement	Erdogan Yagiye Riyadh Kashe Kwiyegereza
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan heads to Saudi Arabia Thursday for a two-day visit aimed at easing old tensions between Ankara and Riyadh.	Ku wa kane, Perezida wa Turkiya, Recep Tayyip Erdogan yerekeje muri Arabiya Sawudite mu ruzinduko rw’iminsi ibiri rugamije kugabanya amakimbirane ashaje hagati ya Ankara na Riyadh.
The Turkish leaders visit with the Saudi king comes after years of rivalry between their once-close countries.	Abayobozi ba Turukiya basuye n’umwami wa Arabiya Sawudite bije nyuma y’imyaka myinshi bahanganye hagati y’ibihugu byabo byahoze.
Mehmet Ogutcu is the head of the London Energy Club, a grouping of government and energy sector leaders. Ogutcu says the visit is the culmination of intense international diplomacy.	Mehmet Ogutcu ni umuyobozi wa Club y’ingufu za Londres, itsinda ry’abayobozi ba guverinoma n’ingufu. Ogutcu avuga ko uruzinduko ari indunduro ya diplomasi mpuzamahanga.
"""President Erdogan has good relations with the king; with the crown prince Muhammad Bin Salman, we had serious difficulties,"" said Ogutcu. ""Now it looks that I believe the*(Britons), and Americans, and the Qataris of course played some role, even the Azeris might have done this. And things are changing and relaxing a bit more, and now at the presidential level, it's going to be sealed."""	"Ogutcu ati: ""Perezida Erdogan afitanye umubano mwiza n'umwami; n'umutware w'ikamba Muhammad Bin Salman, twagize ibibazo bikomeye"". ""Noneho birasa nkaho nizera * (Abongereza), n'Abanyamerika, ndetse na Qatar birumvikana ko hari uruhare bagize, ndetse n'abanya Azerisitani bashobora kuba barabikoze. Kandi ibintu birahinduka kandi biruhura gato, none kurwego rwa perezida, bigiye gushyirwaho kashe. """
Erdogan and the crown prince have been bitter rivals. The Turkish president led international condemnation over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed inside Saudi Arabias consulate in Istanbul.	Erdogan n'umutware w'ikamba babaye abanywanyi bakaze. Perezida wa Turkiya yamaganye amahanga kubera iyicwa ry'umunyamakuru wa Arabiya Sawudite, Jamal Khashoggi, yiciwe muri konsuline ya Arabiya Sawudite i Istanbul.
The killing was linked to the crown prince, a charge he denied. But the decision earlier this month to move the Khashoggi murder trial from Istanbul to Riyadh is seen as a gesture by Ankara, opening the way for Erdogan's visit.	Ubwicanyi bwari bufitanye isano nigikomangoma, ikirego arabihakana. Ariko icyemezo cyatangiye muri uku kwezi cyo kwimura urubanza rw’ubwicanyi rwa Khashoggi kuva Istambul kugera i Riyadh gifatwa nk’ikimenyetso cya Ankara, kikaba cyarafunguye inzira y'uruzinduko rwa Erdogan.
Ogutcu says with presidential elections due next year, Erdogan is looking for Saudi help to bail out the ailing Turkish economy.	Ogutcu avuga ko hamwe n'amatora ya perezida ateganijwe umwaka utaha, Erdogan arimo gushaka ubufasha bwa Arabiya Sawudite kugira ngo akize ubukungu bwa Turukiya burwaye.
"""Turkey has an interest in reviving relations with Riyadh because Turkey needs financial support,"" said Ogutcu. ""The Turkish economy is not attracting any significant portfolio investments nor sovereign wealth funds coming to invest Turkey. But this will be a give-and-take package deal involving these countries. So, there are real economic and political security interests involved."""	"Ogutcu ati: ""Turkiya ishishikajwe no kongera umubano na Riyadh kuko Turukiya ikeneye inkunga y'amafaranga"". ""Ubukungu bwa Turukiya ntabwo bukurura ishoramari rikomeye cyangwa amafaranga y’umutungo wigenga uza gushora Turukiya. Ariko aya azaba amasezerano yo gutanga no gufata ibyemezo birimo ibi bihugu. Ku bw'ibyo, hari inyungu z’ubukungu n’ubukungu bya politiki zirimo."""
Shared concerns over Iran's growing influence in the region -- along with its nuclear energy program -- provide important common ground between Riyadh and Ankara, says international relations professor Soli Ozel of Istanbul's Kadir Has University, especially as American attention is expected to pivot away from the Middle East and toward China.	Umwarimu w’umubano mpuzamahanga, Soli Ozel wo muri kaminuza ya Kadir Has ya kaminuza ya Istanbul, avuga ko impungenge z’uko Irani igenda yiyongera muri kariya karere - hamwe na gahunda yayo y’ingufu za kirimbuzi - bitanga icyerekezo rusange hagati ya Riyadh na Ankara. Uburasirazuba bwo hagati no mu Bushinwa.
"""Turkey does propose itself as a counterweight to Iran. Both countries have an interest along with all the western countries for Iran not to be as influential throughout the region as it is today,"" said Ozel. ""And the Iranians are also constantly sending signals that they are not going to let others draw them away from those countries - Iraq, Lebanon and Syria - where they have quite a lot of influence."""	"Ozel yagize ati: ""Turukiya yiyerekana nk'ikibazo cyo guhangana na Irani. Ibihugu byombi bifite inyungu hamwe n'ibihugu byose byo mu burengerazuba bw'isi kugira ngo Irani itagira uruhare runini mu karere nk'uko bimeze ubu."" ""Kandi Abanyayirani nabo bahora bohereza ibimenyetso byerekana ko batazemera ko abandi babavana muri ibyo bihugu - Iraki, Libani na Siriya - aho bafite uruhare runini."""
Erdogan's Saudi visit is part of a wider policy of seeking to repair relations across the region in a bid to end its isolation. The Turkish president has recently visited the United Arab Emirates and earlier this month hosted the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog.	Uruzinduko rwa Erdogan muri Arabiya Sawudite ni imwe muri politiki yagutse yo gusana umubano mu karere kose hagamijwe guhagarika akato. Perezida wa Turukiya aherutse gusura Leta zunze ubumwe z'Abarabu kandi mu ntangiriro z'uku kwezi yakiriye perezida wa Isiraheli, Isaac Herzog.
But analyst Ozel warns Ankara is in a vulnerable position.	Ariko umusesenguzi Ozel aragabisha Ankara ari mu bihe bigoye.
"""Turkey alienated, insulted, offended a lot of countries with which it had at least decent relations. And they all recognize that this burst of diplomacy is coming out of weakness rather than strength,"" said Ozel."	"Ozel yagize ati: ""Turukiya yitandukanyije, iratukwa, ibabaza ibihugu byinshi byari bifitanye nibura n'imibanire myiza. Kandi bose baremera ko uku guturika kwa diplomasi biva mu ntege nke aho gukomera."""
But analysts say Ankara is banking on its importance as a potential bulwark to Iranian ambitions, a factor that may help overcome any remaining hostility among the neighbors it is trying to win back.	Ariko abasesenguzi bavuga ko Ankara ari banki ku kamaro kayo nk’igihome gikomeye cyo kwifuza kwa Irani, kikaba ari ikintu gishobora gufasha gutsinda inzangano zisigaye mu baturanyi igerageza gutsinda.
Executions, Detentions Hang Over Saudi Legal Reforms	Iyicwa, Gufungwa bamanitse Kuvugurura Amategeko yo muri Arabiya Sawudite
Saudi Arabia is pushing to revamp its harsh justice system but reforms are overshadowed by executions and tough treatment of dissidents, raising questions about how much will change.	Arabiya Sawudite irihatira kuvugurura imikorere y’ubutabera ikarishye ariko ivugurura rirengerwa n’iyicwa ndetse n’ifatwa rikomeye ry’abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi, bitera kwibaza niba byinshi bizahinduka.
The kingdom is known for its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which forms the basis of its judicial system.	Ubwami buzwiho gusobanura byimazeyo amategeko ya shariya ya kisilamu, agize ishingiro ryubucamanza.
But in recent months it has moved ahead with reforms that analysts say could make its courts function more like others in the Middle East.	Ariko mu mezi ashize yateye imbere hamwe n'ivugurura abasesenguzi bavuga ko rishobora gutuma inkiko zayo zikora nk'abandi bo mu burasirazuba bwo hagati.
That effort hinges on a series of new laws for sensitive issues like women's divorce rights and judges' power to determine criminal sentences.	Iyo mbaraga ishingiye ku ruhererekane rw'amategeko mashya ku bibazo byoroshye nk'uburenganzira bwo gutandukana kw'abagore n'ububasha bw'abacamanza bwo kumenya ibihano.
Announced last year by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the measures, including the first written penal code, appear to align with Saudi Arabia's goal of opening up to the world and softening its extremist image.	Byatangajwe umwaka ushize n’umutegetsi w’ikirenga, igikomangoma, Mohammed bin Salman, ingamba, harimo n’igitabo cya mbere cy’amategeko ahana, bigaragara ko zihuye n’intego ya Arabiya Sawudite yo gukingura isi no koroshya isura y’intagondwa.
Even critics concede the changes could make Saudi courts more predictable, in some cases.	Ndetse n'abanenga bemeza ko impinduka zishobora gutuma inkiko zo muri Arabiya Sawudite zishobora guhanurwa, mu bihe bimwe na bimwe.
But there is no expectation that restrictions on free speech will ease, or that the legal system will treat more favorably perceived opponents of the government.	Ariko ntawiteze ko kubuza kuvuga mu bwisanzure bizoroha, cyangwa se ko amategeko azafata neza abatavuga rumwe na leta.
"And despite the reforms, authorities have simultaneously provided reminders of what gave Saudi Arabia its ruthless reputation in the first place, notably the mass execution of 81 men in a single day in March for offenses related to ""terrorism."""	Nubwo hari ivugurura ryakozwe, abayobozi batanze icyarimwe kwibutsa icyahaye Arabiya Sawudite izina ryayo ribi, cyane cyane iyicwa ry’abantu 81 ku munsi umwe muri Werurwe kubera ibyaha bifitanye isano n’iterabwoba.
Notorious' system	Sisitemu izwi
Two new laws have already been approved by the Saudi Cabinet. One governs the admissibility of evidence, previously at the judges' discretion.	Amategeko abiri mashya yamaze kwemezwa na Guverinoma ya Arabiya Sawudite. Umuntu agenga iyakirwa ryibimenyetso, mbere kubushake bwabacamanza.
The second, a family law, is to take effect in June. In a traditionally male-dominated system, it expands the rights of divorced women to alimony and custody of their children.	Iya kabiri, amategeko yumuryango, agomba gukurikizwa muri kamena. Muri gahunda gakondo yiganjemo abagabo, yagura uburenganzira bwabagore bahukanye kubatunga no kurera abana babo.
"Announcing the new law in March, Prince Mohammed said it represented ""a major qualitative leap"" for women's rights and ""family stability."""	"Mu kwezi kwa Werurwe, igikomangoma Mohammed yatangaje iryo tegeko rishya, yavuze ko rihagarariye ""gusimbuka ubuziranenge"" ku burenganzira bw'umugore no ""gutekana mu muryango."""
The reforms seem partly to cater to foreign firms whose investment the kingdom is courting, said Adel al-Saeed, vice president of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights.	Adel al-Saeed, visi perezida w’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi ushinzwe uburenganzira bwa muntu, Adel al-Saeed yavuze ko iryo vugurura risa nkaho ryita ku masosiyete y’amahanga ashora imari mu bwami.
"""The owners of capital are afraid of investing in this country, which is notorious in the legal aspect, so these laws are intended to change the image,"" he said."	"Ati: ""Ba nyir'imari bafite ubwoba bwo gushora imari muri iki gihugu, kizwiho amategeko, bityo aya mategeko agamije guhindura isura""."
The new penal code, yet to be unveiled, could bring further dramatic changes.	Igitabo gishya cy'amategeko ahana, kitarashyirwa ahagaragara, gishobora kuzana izindi mpinduka zikomeye.
Under sharia, only apostasy, theft, revolt, armed robbery, adultery, drinking alcohol and slander carry prescribed sentences. Judges are left to determine punishment in other cases.	Muri shariya, ubuhakanyi, ubujura, kwigomeka, ubujura bwitwaje intwaro, gusambana, kunywa inzoga no gusebanya bitwara ibihano byateganijwe. Abacamanza basigaye bagena ibihano mu zindi manza.
"With a penal code in place, ""the state will expect judges to rely not on their own training in sharia but instead on the legal rules (based on sharia) approved by the state,"" said Nathan Brown, an academic at George Washington University."	"Hamwe n’amategeko ahana, ""leta izateganya ko abacamanza batashingira ku mahugurwa yabo bwite muri shariya ahubwo bakurikiza amategeko (ashingiye kuri shariya) yemejwe na leta"", ibi bikaba byavuzwe na Nathan Brown, umunyeshuri muri kaminuza ya George Washington."
"""As a result, Saudi Arabia will look much more like a civil law system, much like most states in the region,"" said Brown, who has studied the Saudi reforms."	"Brown wize ku ivugurura rya Arabiya Sawudite yagize ati: ""Kubera iyo mpamvu, Arabiya Sawudite izasa cyane na gahunda y’amategeko mbonezamubano, kimwe na Leta nyinshi zo mu karere."""
"The result should be more ""predictability,"" said Abdullah Alaoudh, a U.S.-based legal expert and government critic, as new rules ""take away from the leeway ... that the judges used to have."""	"Ibisubizo bigomba kurushaho kuba ""guhanura"", nk'uko byavuzwe na Abdullah Alaoudh, impuguke mu by'amategeko ukomoka muri Amerika akaba anenga guverinoma, kubera ko amategeko mashya ""akuraho inzira ... abacamanza bari bafite."""
"But tighter regulation by the monarchy also ""creates a larger problem: lack of independence,"" he added."	"Yongeyeho ko ariko gukurikiza amategeko agenga ubwami nabyo ""bitera ikibazo kinini: kubura ubwigenge""."
The king is the head of the Saudi judiciary and acts as the final court of appeal.	Umwami ni umuyobozi wubutabera bwa Arabiya Sawudite kandi akora nkurukiko rwa nyuma rwubujurire.
Alaoudh's own father, prominent cleric Salman al-Awdah, has been held since 2017, seemingly in retaliation for a Twitter post that clashed with Saudi Arabia's policy at the time of isolating Qatar.	Se wa Alaoudh, umunyamadini ukomeye Salman al-Awdah, afunzwe kuva mu 2017, bisa nkaho ari ukwihorera ku rubuga rwa Twitter ruvuguruzanya na politiki ya Arabiya Sawudite mu gihe cyo guha akato Qatar.
He is one of many detained in an apparent crackdown on dissent and those who could challenge Prince Mohammed's power.	Ni umwe mu bantu benshi bafunzwe mu rwego rwo guhashya abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi ndetse n’abashobora guhangana n’ubutegetsi bwa Muganwa Mohammed.
One of the most prominent examples is former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the CIA ally respected in the West for his efforts to counter violent extremism, but who King Salman ousted from the line of succession.	Imwe mu ngero zikomeye ni uwahoze ari igikomangoma cy’ikamba, Mohammed bin Nayef, umufasha wa CIA wubahwa mu Burengerazuba kubera umuhate we wo kurwanya ubuhezanguni, ariko Umwami Salman yirukanye ku murongo w'izungura.
Prince Nayef has not been seen in public since reports of his arrest in March 2020. His detention was never officially confirmed.	Igikomangoma Nayef ntabwo yagaragaye mu ruhame kuva amakuru avuga ko yafashwe muri Werurwe 2020. Ifungwa rye ntiryigeze ryemezwa ku mugaragaro.
Shadow of Khashoggi	Igicucu cya Khashoggi
For government opponents, such cases reinforce questions about what difference the ongoing justice reforms will make.	Kubatavuga rumwe na leta, imanza nkizo zishimangira ibibazo bijyanye n’itandukaniro ivugurura ry’ubutabera rizagira.
"""In my view, this is all window-dressing,"" said Madawi al-Rasheed, a U.K.-based academic and spokesperson for the opposition National Assembly Party founded by exiles."	"Madawi al-Rasheed, umunyeshuri ukomoka muri Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika akaba n'umuvugizi w'ishyaka ry’inteko ishinga amategeko ritavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi ryashinzwe n’abajyanywe mu bunyage, yagize ati: ""Njye mbona, ibi byose byambaye idirishya""."
"""It's very, very difficult to see what the meaning is of these reforms apart from the project of portraying (Prince Mohammed) as a reformer."""	"""Biragoye cyane, kubona icyo iryo vugurura risobanura usibye umushinga wo kwerekana (Prince Mohammed) nk'umuntu uvugurura."""
Hanging over any discussion of justice and legal reform in Saudi Arabia is the 2018 murder and dismemberment of critic and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.	Kuzamura ikiganiro icyo ari cyo cyose cyerekeye ubutabera n’ivugurura ry’amategeko muri Arabiya Sawudite ni ubwicanyi no gutandukanya abanegura n’umwanditsi Jamal Khashoggi muri konsulasi y’ubwami ya Istanbul.
"A U.S. intelligence assessment found Prince Mohammed himself ""approved"" an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, though Saudi officials deny this and say it was a ""rogue"" operation."	"Isuzuma ry’ubutasi ry’Amerika ryasanze igikomangoma Mohammed ubwe ""yemeye"" igikorwa cyo gufata cyangwa kwica Khashoggi, nubwo abayobozi ba Arabiya Sawudite babihakana bakavuga ko ari igikorwa ""kibi""."
In April, before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Riyadh on Thursday and embraced Prince Mohammed, Turkey transferred the trial in absentia of 26 suspects in the Khashoggi case to Saudi Arabia.	Muri Mata, mbere yuko Perezida wa Turkiya, Recep Tayyip Erdogan asura Riyadh ku wa kane maze ahobera igikomangoma Mohammed, Turukiya yimuriye urubanza adahari abantu 26 bakekwaho icyaha cya Khashoggi muri Arabiya Sawudite.
Turkey's decision drew anguished protest from lawyers and Khashoggi's fiancée, who insisted Saudi courts couldn't possibly hold a credible trial.	Icyemezo cya Turukiya cyamaganye abanyamategeko ndetse n'umukunzi wa Khashoggi, bashimangira ko inkiko zo muri Arabiya Sawudite zidashobora kuburanishwa mu buryo bwizewe.
For the loved ones of those locked away, Khashoggi's killing fuels a uniform fear of speaking out.	Ku bakunzi bafunzwe, iyicwa rya Khashoggi ritera ubwoba bumwe bwo kuvuga.
"""I want to, many do, but we're scared,"" said a friend of Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, who has been detained along with his father since 2018."	"Inshuti y'igikomangoma Salman bin Abdulaziz wafunzwe na se kuva mu 2018, yagize ati: ""Ndashaka, benshi barabikora, ariko dufite ubwoba."""
"""Everyone knows what happened to Khashoggi."""	"""Abantu bose bazi ibyabaye kuri Khashoggi."""
Moroccan Prison Program Sets Out to De-Radicalize IS Veterans	Gahunda ya Gereza ya Maroc Yashyizweho Kuri De-Radicalize IS Veterans
"As a combatant for the Islamic State group who left his native Morocco to join what he felt was a holy fight in Syria, Mohsin says he saw all the horrors of war. ""A terrifying experience,"" he says."	"Ati: ""Nk'umurwanyi w'umutwe wa kisilamu wavuye muri Maroc kavukire kugira ngo yinjire mu byo yumvaga ko ari intambara yera muri Siriya, Mohsin avuga ko yabonye amahano yose y'intambara."" Ati: ""Ibintu biteye ubwoba."""
Now a prisoner, the 38-year-old claims he is no longer the fanatic he was then, enraged with a murderous hatred for non-Muslims. Captured in Turkey and extradited to Morocco, he is serving a 10-year prison term on terrorism charges.	Noneho imfungwa, ufite imyaka 38 y'amavuko avuga ko atakiri umufana icyo gihe, yarakajwe n'inzangano z'ubwicanyi ku batari Abayisilamu. Yafatiwe muri Turukiya yoherezwa muri Maroc, akatiwe igifungo cy'imyaka 10 ashinjwa iterabwoba.
Now the former fighter has graduated with 14 other prisoners convicted of terror offenses from a Morocco de-radicalization program that might make them more eligible for an early release.	Ubu uwahoze ari umurwanyi yahawe impamyabumenyi hamwe n’abandi bagororwa 14 bahamwe n’icyaha cy’iterabwoba muri gahunda ya Maroc de-radicalisation ishobora gutuma bemererwa kurekurwa hakiri kare.
The Associated Press and other media were invited to observe their graduation ceremony Thursday in a prison in Sale near the Moroccan capital, Rabat, and to interview some prisoners under monitored and controlled conditions. Prison administration officials picked out three men they said were willing to be interviewed.	Ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abanyamerika Associated Press hamwe n'ibindi bitangazamakuru byatumiwe kureba umuhango wo gutanga impamyabumenyi ku wa kane muri gereza i Sale hafi y'umurwa mukuru wa Maroc, Rabat, no kubaza imfungwa zimwe na zimwe zikurikiranwa kandi zikagenzurwa. Abayobozi ba gereza batoye abagabo batatu bavuga ko bafite ubushake bwo kubazwa.
Officials stipulated that the inmates shouldn't be identified by their full names and that their faces mustn't be shown, citing privacy reasons.	Abayobozi bavuze ko abagororwa batagomba kumenyekana ku mazina yabo yose kandi ko mu maso habo hatagomba kwerekanwa, kubera impamvu z’ibanga.
But prison officials didn't listen to the interviews or intervene to shut down media lines of questioning or inmates' answers.	Ariko abayobozi ba gereza ntibigeze bumva ibibazo cyangwa ngo bagire icyo bakora kugira ngo bahagarike umurongo w'itangazamakuru ryo kubaza cyangwa ibisubizo by'abagororwa.
The 15 inmates in crisp shirts and trousers stood solemnly for Morocco's national anthem and were handed certificates. Prison officials said the de-radicalization program consisted of three months of classes in prison on religion, law and economics, and that inmates also received training on how to start a business. These most recent graduates were the ninth batch since the program started in 2017.	Abagororwa 15 bambaye amashati n'ipantaro bahagaze neza kubera indirimbo yubahiriza igihugu cya Maroc kandi bahabwa ibyemezo. Abayobozi ba gereza bavuze ko gahunda ya de-radicalisation yari igizwe n’amezi atatu muri gereza ku bijyanye n’idini, amategeko n’ubukungu, kandi ko abagororwa na bo bahawe amahugurwa y’uburyo bwo gutangiza umushinga. Aba barangije vuba ni icyiciro cya cyenda kuva gahunda yatangira muri 2017.
"Moulay Idriss Agoulmam, the director of social-cultural action and prisoner reintegration at Morocco's prison administration, said the program is entirely voluntary and works with inmates ""to change their behavior and improve their life path."""	"Umuyobozi ushinzwe ibikorwa by’imibereho n’umuco no gusubiza mu buzima busanzwe imfungwa ku buyobozi bwa gereza ya Maroc, Moulay Idriss Agoulmam, yavuze ko iyi gahunda ari ubushake kandi ko ikorana n’abagororwa ""guhindura imyitwarire yabo no kuzamura imibereho yabo."""
"""It enables prisoners to form an awareness of the gravity of their mistakes,"" he said."	"Ati: ""Bituma imfungwa zimenyekanisha uburemere bw'amakosa yabo""."
Graduating from the program doesn't make inmates automatically eligible for early release, but does increase their chances of getting a royal pardon or a reduced sentence. That's been the case for just over half the program's 222 graduates so far, the prison administration says. Since 2019, the training has also been offered to women convicted under Morocco's Anti-Terrorism Act. Ten women have graduated so far — all of them since released, including eight with pardons.	Kurangiza porogaramu ntibituma abagororwa bahita bemererwa kurekurwa hakiri kare, ariko byongera amahirwe yo kubona imbabazi zumwami cyangwa kugabanyirizwa ibihano. Ubuyobozi bwa gereza buvuga ko ibyo byabaye ku barenga kimwe cya kabiri cy'abanyeshuri 222 barangije porogaramu kugeza ubu. Kuva mu mwaka wa 2019, amahugurwa yahawe kandi abagore bahamwe n'icyaha hakurikijwe itegeko ryo kurwanya iterabwoba muri Maroc. Abagore icumi barangije kugeza ubu - bose kuva barekuwe, harimo umunani bafite imbabazi.
"Called ""Moussalaha,"" meaning ""reconciliation"" in Arabic, the program is offered to prisoners who have demonstrated a readiness to disavow extremism."	"Iyi gahunda yiswe ""Moussalaha,"" bisobanura ""ubwiyunge"" mucyarabu, iyi gahunda ihabwa imfungwa zagaragaje ko ziteguye kwanga ubuhezanguni."
"Mohsin said he left to fight in Syria in 2012. A school dropout as a teen, he said he ""was virtually illiterate and couldn't discern good from bad."" He said he was radicalized by people who showed him extremist videos ""about the divine obligation to battle those who don't follow Islamic principles and to murder non-Muslims."""	"""Mohsin yavuze ko yavuye kurwana muri Siriya mu 2012. Yataye ishuri akiri ingimbi, yavuze ko"" ""yari azi gusoma no kwandika kandi ko adashobora gutandukanya icyiza n'ikibi."" "" kubyerekeye inshingano ziva ku Mana zo kurwanya abadakurikiza amahame ya kisilamu no kwica abatari Abayisilamu. """""
"In Syria, ""I saw massacres, rapes, and thefts,"" he said. ""I concluded after a time that the fight being conducted in the name of Islam had nothing to do with our religion."""	"Ati: ""Muri Siriya,"" Nabonye ubwicanyi, gufata ku ngufu n'ubujura "". ""Nafashe umwanzuro nyuma y'igihe ko intambara ikorwa mu izina rya Islamu ntaho ihuriye n'idini ryacu."""
He escaped to Turkey in 2018 and was detained for a year there before being extradited to Morocco.	Yahungiye muri Turukiya mu 2018, afungirwa umwaka umwe mbere yo koherezwa muri Maroc.
He says he has now disavowed extremism.	Avuga ko ubu yanze ubuhezanguni.
"""That period of my life has passed,"" he said."	"Ati: ""Icyo gihe cy'ubuzima bwanjye cyarashize."""
Numerous Moroccans have traveled to Syria, Iraq and elsewhere to join extremist groups. Morocco has also experienced multiple attacks itself. Five suicide attacks in Casablanca in 2003 killed 33 people. In 2011, an explosion destroyed a cafe in Marrakech, killing 17 people, most of them foreign tourists.	Abanyamerika benshi bagiye muri Siriya, Iraki n'ahandi kugira ngo binjire mu mitwe y'intagondwa. Maroc nayo yahuye n'ibitero byinshi ubwayo. Ibitero bitanu byo kwiyahura byabereye i Casablanca mu 2003 byahitanye abantu 33. Mu 2011, igisasu cyaturikiye ikawa i Marrakech, gihitana abantu 17, abenshi muri bo bakaba ari ba mukerarugendo b'abanyamahanga.
Al Mustapaha Razrazi, a clinical psychologist and member of the program's scientific committee, said among 156 people who have been released after attending the courses, just one has been caught committing a crime again.	Al Mustapaha Razrazi, inzobere mu by'imitekerereze ya muntu akaba n'umwe mu bagize komite ishinzwe ubumenyi muri iyo gahunda, yavuze ko mu bantu 156 barekuwe nyuma yo kwitabira amasomo, umwe gusa yongeye gufatwa akora icyaha.
That person was convicted of a non-terrorism-related offense, he said.	Yavuze ko uwo muntu yahamijwe n'icyaha kijyanye n'iterabwoba.
Iran Gets Opportunity to Sell Auto Parts to Russian Carmaker	Irani ibonye amahirwe yo kugurisha ibice by'imodoka ku Barusiya bakora imodoka.
A member of Iran's syndicate of car parts manufacturers says Iranian producers have an opportunity to export their wares to a Russian carmaker, state media reported.	Ibitangazamakuru bya Leta byatangaje ko umunyamuryango wa syndicat ya Irani y’ibicuruzwa by’imodoka avuga ko abakora muri Irani bafite amahirwe yo kohereza ibicuruzwa byabo mu ruganda rukora imodoka mu Burusiya.
"The late Monday report quoted Hossein Bahrainian as saying ""a prominent Russian car maker"" requested parts from Iran. He did not name the manufacturer. He said it requested brake parts, airbags, air-conditioner parts and other components."	"Raporo yo ku wa mbere yarangiye ivuga ko Hossein Bahrein yavuze ko ""uruganda rukomeye rw’imodoka yo mu Burusiya"" rwasabye ibice muri Irani. Ntiyavuze uwabikoze. Yavuze ko isaba ibice bya feri, ibikapu byo mu kirere, ibyuma bifata ibyuma bikonjesha n'ibindi bikoresho."
Both Iran and Russia are under U.S. sanctions but the export of Iranian cars and car parts is not subject to sanctions.	Irani n'Uburusiya byombi bihanishwa Amerika ariko kohereza imodoka za Irani n'ibice by'imodoka ntabwo bihanwa.
The import of automobiles to Iran is also not subject to sanctions. However, Tehran has not imported cars since 2018, after the U.S. withdrew from a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed oil and banking sanctions on Iran.	Gutumiza imodoka muri Irani nabyo ntabwo bihanwa. Icyakora, Tehran ntabwo yatumije imodoka kuva mu 2018, nyuma y’uko Amerika ivuye mu masezerano ya kirimbuzi hagati ya Irani n’ibihugu by’isi ndetse ikanafatira Irani ibihano bya peteroli na banki.
Western nations stopped exporting to Russia after the invasion of Ukraine.	Ibihugu by’iburengerazuba byahagaritse kohereza mu Burusiya nyuma yo gutera Ukraine.
Iran in recent years has exported car radiators and suspension systems to Russia. In the past it exported cars to Iraq, Syria and Venezuela.	Irani mu myaka yashize yohereje mu Burusiya imirasire y’imodoka na sisitemu zo guhagarika. Kera yoherezaga imodoka muri Iraki, Siriya na Venezuwela.
Tehran and Moscow have had close relations in recent years, especially after Iran's sole nuclear power plant went online in 2011 with help from Russia.	Tehran na Moscou bafitanye umubano wa hafi mu myaka yashize, cyane cyane nyuma y’uko uruganda rukora ingufu za kirimbuzi rukumbi rwa Irani rujya kuri interineti mu 2011 babifashijwemo n’Uburusiya.
Separately on Tuesday, Iran said it has played a mediatory role in the war in Ukraine.	Ku wa kabiri, Irani yavuze ko yagize uruhare mu bunzi mu ntambara yo muri Ukraine.
"""So far twice I have conveyed messages from the foreign minister of Ukraine to my Russian counterpart,"" said Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian in a phone conversation with his Irish counterpart. He said Iran supports diplomatic solutions for restoring peace and stability."	"Minisitiri w’ububanyi n’amahanga Hossein Amir Abdollahian mu kiganiro kuri telefoni na mugenzi we wa Irlande yagize ati: ""Kugeza ubu inshuro ebyiri zose nagejeje ubutumwa kuri minisitiri w’ububanyi n’amahanga wa Ukraine kuri mugenzi wanjye w’Uburusiya."" Yavuze ko Irani ishyigikiye ibisubizo by’ububanyi n’amahanga mu kugarura amahoro n’amahoro."
"Abdollahian did not elaborate but said Iran ""opposes war and displacement of human beings in Ukraine,"" and other paces like Yemen, the Palestinian lands and Afghanistan."	"Abdollahian ntabwo yabisobanuye ariko yavuze ko Irani ""irwanya intambara no kwimura abantu muri Ukraine,"" ndetse n'indi ntera nka Yemeni, ibihugu bya Palesitine na Afuganisitani."
Diversity, New Perspectives Are Applied to Middle East Coverage	Dutandukanye, Ibitekerezo bishya bikoreshwa muburasirazuba bwo hagati
Natalia Sancha has always adopted a collaborative approach to journalism. When out on assignment, she speaks to others covering the same story about their perspectives.	Nataliya Sancha yamye afata inzira yo gufatanya mubanyamakuru. Iyo asohotse mukoro, avugana nabandi bavuga inkuru imwe kubitekerezo byabo.
This partly stems from an interest in telling underreported stories, but as a female journalist in a male-dominated region, she says collaboration and supporting the women she works with have always been important.	Ibi bimwe bituruka ku gushimishwa no kuvuga inkuru zidasobanutse, ariko nkumunyamakuru wumugore mukarere kariganjemo abagabo, avuga ko ubufatanye no gutera inkunga abagore bakorana byahoze ari ngombwa.
"""I would talk to male and female journalists, and I always realized that women had a similar perspective, because we had similar experiences while covering the story,"" the 42-year-old journalist said."	"Umunyamakuru w'imyaka 42 yagize ati: ""Naganiriye n'abanyamakuru b'abagabo n'abagore, kandi buri gihe nabonaga ko abagore bafite imyumvire imwe, kuko natwe twagize ibyabaye mugihe twatangaga inkuru""."
That collaborative approach came into play in 2020 when a publisher asked Sancha if she was interested in writing a book about Syria.	Ubwo buryo bwo gufatanya bwatangiye gukurikizwa mu 2020 ubwo umubwiriza yabazaga Sancha niba ashishikajwe no kwandika igitabo kivuga kuri Siriya.
She countered with a better offer.	Yarwanyije icyifuzo cyiza.
"""I told him that a collective narrative by women journalists about the broader region would have a different effect,"" she said. ""I could have written the book myself, but it would not have the same sense."""	"Ati: ""Namubwiye ko inkuru rusange y'abanyamakuru b'abagore ivuga ku karere kanini byagira ingaruka zitandukanye."" ""Nanjye ubwanjye nashoboraga kwandika igitabo, ariko ntabwo cyari kumva kimwe."""
Originally from Andalusia in southern Spain, Sancha spent the past 14 years in the Middle East covering conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and reporting from Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia.	Sancha ukomoka muri Andalusiya mu majyepfo ya Espagne, Sancha yamaze imyaka 14 ishize mu burasirazuba bwo hagati yerekana amakimbirane yo muri Iraki, Siriya na Yemeni, kandi atanga raporo avuye muri Egiputa, Libani na Tuniziya.
She has been working more recently with the European Union communications department, after leaving Beirut for health reasons following a mass explosion that rocked the city in 2020.	Aherutse gukorana n’ishami ry’itumanaho ry’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi, nyuma yo kuva i Beirut kubera impamvu z’ubuzima nyuma y’igiturika kinini cyibasiye umujyi muri 2020.
"Women ""have a different experience because we would go to places that our male colleagues were not used to. Not because we're smarter, but just because the majority of the region is still Arab, Muslim and gender-segregated,"" Sancha told VOA."	"Sancha yabwiye VOA ati: ""Abagore"" bafite uburambe butandukanye kuko twajya ahantu bagenzi bacu b'igitsina gabo batamenyereye. Ntabwo ari ukubera ko turi abanyabwenge, ahubwo ni ukubera ko igice kinini cy'akarere kikiri abarabu, abayisilamu ndetse n'abagabo."""
Having women reporters has an impact, she noted.	Yavuze ko kugira abanyamakuru b'abagore bigira ingaruka.
"""If I put myself in the position of the reader, I would prefer to have a woman telling me the story because it is going to be about 100 percent of the population, which means you are going to have a more inclusive narrative on the conflict."""	"""Niba nishyize mu mwanya w'abasomyi, nahitamo kugira umugore umbwira inkuru kuko igiye kuba hafi 100 ku ijana by'abaturage, bivuze ko uzaba ufite inkuru zuzuye zirimo amakimbirane."""
For her book, Sancha reached out to other women who cover the Middle East, to ensure diverse perspectives from foreign and local reporters.	Ku gitabo cye, Sancha yageze ku bandi bagore bavuga iburasirazuba bwo hagati, kugira ngo babone ibitekerezo bitandukanye n'abanyamakuru bo mu mahanga ndetse n'abenegihugu.
The result of the nearly two-year collaboration is Bullets for All, released in Spanish in April.	Ibisubizo byubufatanye bwimyaka hafi ibiri ni Bullets kuri Bose, yasohotse mu cyesipanyoli muri Mata.
"In the book, ""we tell one story with different voices that represent all the women"" from the region, Sancha said."	"Muri iki gitabo, Sancha yagize ati: ""Muri iki gitabo,"" tuvuga inkuru imwe n'amajwi atandukanye ahagarariye abagore bose ""."
Each offers a personal perspective on covering historic moments, including the collapse of autocratic governments, popular protest movements and war. It also examines the discrimination and harassment women face in the newsroom and on assignment.	Buri kimwe gitanga icyerekezo cyihariye cyo kwerekana ibihe byamateka, harimo gusenyuka kwa guverinoma yigenga, imyigaragambyo yamamaye nintambara. Irasuzuma kandi ivangura n'ihohoterwa abagore bahura nabyo mu cyumba cy'amakuru no ku mukoro.
Making connections	Gukora amasano
Understanding language and culture goes a long way toward making progress in the region, says Maya Gebeily. The Reuters bureau chief for Lebanon, Syria and Jordan is one of the contributors to the book.	Maya Gebeily avuga ko gusobanukirwa ururimi n'umuco bigana inzira igana ku iterambere. Umuyobozi w'ikigo cya Reuters muri Libani, Siriya na Yorodani ni umwe mu bagize uruhare muri iki gitabo.
"""There's a lot to say and show from the perspective of women reporters who were also then influenced by the women that they met as they were doing their reporting,"" she said."	"Ati: ""Hariho byinshi byo kuvuga no kwerekana nkurikije uko abanyamakuru b'abagore na bo bahise bayoborwa n'abagore bahuye igihe bakoraga raporo zabo""."
Born in the U.S. to Lebanese parents, Gebeily started her journalism career in 2013 with a local news site in Beirut, Lebanon. She went on to cover the region for Agence France-Presse before joining Reuters.	Gebeily yavukiye muri Amerika ku babyeyi bo muri Libani, yatangiye umwuga we w'itangazamakuru mu 2013 akoresheje urubuga rw'amakuru i Beirut, muri Libani. Yakomeje yerekeza mu karere ka Agence France-Presse mbere yo kwinjira muri Reuters.
Gebeily said her American and Lebanese background helped her understand the region better, which in turn has shaped her reporting. Knowing the local language is an important part of that.	Gebeily yavuze ko amateka ye y'Abanyamerika na Libani yamufashije kumva neza akarere, ari nako kagize uruhare mu gutanga raporo. Kumenya ururimi rwaho nigice cyingenzi cyibyo.
"""When interviewing a minister or a displaced person or an activist, the most important element is getting their trust,"" she said. ""If you're able to speak the language and make them feel comfortable from the beginning, it changes everything. It grants you a very beautiful kind of access."""	"Ati: ""Iyo ubajije minisitiri cyangwa umuntu wimuwe cyangwa umurwanashyaka, ikintu cy'ingenzi ni ukugirira icyizere."" ""Niba ushoboye kuvuga ururimi no gutuma bumva bamerewe neza kuva mu ntangiriro, bihindura byose. Iraguha uburyo bwiza cyane bwo kwinjira."""
In addition to Iraq and Lebanon, Gebeily, 30, has also traveled to Syria to cover the war against the Islamic State (IS) militant group.	Usibye Iraki na Libani, Gebeily w'imyaka 30 yanagiye muri Siriya kugira ngo akurikirane intambara yo kurwanya umutwe w'abarwanyi ba Leta ya Kisilamu (IS).
"""Ive been very privileged to access some communities directly without having to work with a translator or a fixer, which also shapes the way that the stories come out,"" she said."	"Ati: ""Ive nagize amahirwe yo kugera ku baturage mu buryo butaziguye ntiriwe nkorana n'umusemuzi cyangwa uwakosoye, ibyo bikaba binerekana uburyo inkuru zisohoka""."
Syrian-Kurdish journalist Khabat Abbas, who has covered the war in Syria, attests to the importance of that.	Umunyamakuru wa Siriya-Kurdiya, Khabat Abbas, wanditse ku ntambara yo muri Siriya, ahamya akamaro kayo.
"""Its knowing the language and the culture that gives people a sense of comfort to open up to you,"" she told VOA from Qamishli, Syria."	"Yatangarije VOA avuye i Qamishli, muri Siriya ati: ""Kumenya ururimi n'umuco biha abantu ihumure ryo kukwugururira."""
That knowledge helped when Abbas, 34, was on assignment with Sancha in March 2021.

Ubwo bumenyi bwafashije igihe Abbas w'imyaka 34 yari mu butumwa na Sancha muri Werurwe 2021. Baragiye mu kigo cy’imfungwa cy’Abanyakorde mu majyaruguru y’amajyaruguru ya Siriya maze babaza abajihadiste b’abagore bafitanye isano na IS, kugira ngo babone inkuru muri El Pais.
"""While in Qamishli [in northeast Syria], I ran into two British journalists, very good colleagues of mine, who were disappointed after Shamima Begum and other women at the camp refused to talk to them,"" Sancha said, referring to a young woman who left her home in Britain aged 15 to join IS."	"Sancha yagize ati: ""Nkiri i Qamishli [mu majyaruguru y'uburasirazuba bwa Siriya], nahungiye mu banyamakuru babiri b'Abongereza, abo dukorana cyane, batengushye nyuma yuko Shamima Begum n'abandi bagore bari mu nkambi banze kuvugana nabo."" wavuye iwe mu Bwongereza afite imyaka 15 yinjira muri IS."
"""Their fixer was a man, so the jihadist women didnt talk to them because they are radical, and they dont talk to men.

Abbas had a role in getting to talk to those women, she added.	Yongeyeho ko Abbas yagize uruhare mu kubona abo bagore.
Unlike Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas grew up in the marginalized Kurdish region of Syria, where until the war began in 2011, journalism effectively didnt exist.

Iran's Guards Commander Says Israel Creating Conditions for Own Destruction	Umuyobozi w'ingabo za Irani avuga ko Isiraheli ishyiraho uburyo bwo kurimbuka
Israel's actions are creating conditions for its own destruction, Irans Revolutionary Guards commander on Friday told a Jerusalem Day rally at which the countrys new domestically-made Kheibar Buster missile was displayed.	Ku wa gatanu, umuyobozi w’ingabo z’abasirikare barinda impinduramatwara ya Irans, yatangaje ko ibikorwa bya Isiraheli bitera uburyo bwo kurimbuka kwayo.
State television said millions of Iranians joined rallies marking Quds Day, the Arabic name for Jerusalem, in state-organized marches across the country.	Televiziyo ya Leta yavuze ko miliyoni z'Abanyayirani bitabiriye imyigaragambyo yizihizaga umunsi wa Quds, izina ry'icyarabu ryitwa Yeruzalemu, mu rugendo rwateguwe na leta mu gihugu hose.
"It showed the Israeli flag being set on fire and groups of people around the country shouting choreographed ""Death to America, Death to Israel"" slogans."	"Yerekanye ibendera rya Isiraheli ritwikwa hamwe nitsinda ryabantu hirya no hino basakuza koreografiya ""Urupfu muri Amerika, Urupfu kuri Isiraheli""."
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised speech that anti-Israeli protests and attacks showed that Palestinians rejected compromises by Arab authorities with Israel.	Umuyobozi w'ikirenga, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, mu ijambo rye kuri televiziyo yavuze ko imyigaragambyo n'ibitero byo kurwanya Isiraheli byerekanaga ko Abanyapalestine banze kumvikana n'abayobozi b'Abarabu na Isiraheli.
Opposition to Israel is a touchstone of belief for Iran, which backs Palestinian and Lebanese Islamist militant groups opposed to peace with Israel, which Tehran does not recognize.	Kurwanya Isiraheli ni ibuye rikomeye ku myizerere ya Irani, ishyigikiye imitwe yitwara gisirikare ya kisilamu ya Palesitine na Libani irwanya amahoro na Isiraheli, Tehran ikaba itemera.
"""What has happened in Palestine in recent years annuls all plans for compromise with the Zionist enemy (Israel) because no plan for Palestine can be implemented in the absence or contrary to the opinions of its owners, the Palestinians,"" Khamenei said, speaking in Arabic and addressing Palestinians and other Arabs."	"Mu magambo ye, Khamenei yagize ati: ""Ibyabereye muri Palesitine mu myaka yashize bivanaho gahunda zose zo kumvikana n’umwanzi w’abaziyoniste (Isiraheli) kuko nta gahunda ya Palesitine ishobora gushyirwa mu bikorwa idahari cyangwa binyuranye n’ibitekerezo bya ba nyirayo, Abanyapalestine"". Icyarabu no kuvugana nabanyapalestine nabandi barabu."
"Thus, Khamenei said, all previous peace agreements -- such as the 1993 Oslo Accords, the two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and former U.S. President Donald Trump's plan dubbed the Deal of the Century ""are null and void""."	"Ni yo mpamvu, Khamenei yavuze ko amasezerano y’amahoro yabanjirije aya - nk’amasezerano ya Oslo yo mu 1993, igisubizo cy’ibihugu byombi kugira ngo gikemure amakimbirane hagati ya Isiraheli na Palesitine, ndetse n’umugambi wahoze ari Perezida wa Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika, Donald Trump wise amasezerano y’ikinyejana ""nta gaciro ufite."""
President Ebrahim Raisi, Irans military commanders and senior officials also attended the rallies in which people were allowed to march through the streets, the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic two years ago.	Perezida Ebrahim Raisi, abayobozi b'ingabo za Irans n'abayobozi bakuru na bo bitabiriye imyigaragambyo aho abantu bemerewe kugenda mu mihanda, ku nshuro ya mbere kuva icyorezo cya coronavirus gitangira mu myaka ibiri ishize.
Iran's Jerusalem Day rallies are held annually in support of Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state in territories captured by Israel in a 1967 war, on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.	Igiterane cy’umunsi wa Yeruzalemu cya Irani kiba buri mwaka mu rwego rwo gushyigikira Abanyapalestine, bifuza ko Yeruzalemu y’iburasirazuba iba umurwa mukuru w’igihugu kizaza mu turere twafashwe na Isiraheli mu ntambara yo mu 1967, ku wa gatanu wanyuma w’ukwezi kwa Ramazani kwisonzesha kw’abayisilamu.
"""Stop your vicious deeds. You know well that we are people of action and reaction,"" Revolutionary Guards commander Hossein Salami, addressing Israel, told demonstrators in Tehran."	"Umuyobozi w'ingabo zishinzwe impinduramatwara, Hossein Salami, yabwiye Isiraheli, yabwiye abigaragambyaga i Tehran ati: ""Hagarika ibikorwa byawe bibi. Uzi neza ko turi abantu bakora kandi bakitwara neza."""
"""Our responses are painful. You create conditions for your own destruction. We will not leave you alone ...You know better than me what will befall you if you take evil action."""	"""Ibisubizo byacu birababaje. Ushiraho uburyo bwo kurimbuka kwawe. Ntabwo tuzagutererana wenyine ... Uzi kundusha ibizakubaho uramutse ufashe nabi."""
Iran's military has vowed to retaliate harshly against any attack by Israel, which has often voiced concern over the Iranian nuclear program. Tehran says the program is for peaceful purposes only.	Igisirikare cya Irani cyiyemeje kwihorera bikabije igitero icyo ari cyo cyose cyagabwe na Isiraheli, cyakunze kugaragaza impungenge kuri gahunda ya kirimbuzi ya Irani. Tehran ivuga ko gahunda igamije amahoro gusa.
Israel, whose existence the Islamic Republic does not recognize, has long threatened military action against Iran if talks between Tehran and world powers fail to curb Iranian nuclear activity. Iran says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful.	Isiraheli, repubulika ya kisilamu itabaho, imaze igihe kinini itera ubwoba ibikorwa bya gisirikare byo kurwanya Irani niba ibiganiro hagati ya Tehran n’ibihugu by’ibihugu bidashoboye guhagarika ibikorwa bya kirimbuzi bya Irani. Irani ivuga ko intego zayo za kirimbuzi ari amahoro.
"In February, the Islamic Republic unveiled its ""Kheibar Buster"" missile with a range of 1,450 km (900 miles)."	"Muri Gashyantare, Repubulika ya Kisilamu yashyize ahagaragara misile yayo ""Kheibar Buster"" ifite uburebure bwa kilometero 1,450."
Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programs in the Middle East, says its ballistic missiles have a range of up to 2,000 km (1,200 miles) and are capable of reaching its arch-foe Israel and U.S. bases in the region.	Irani, ifite imwe muri gahunda zikomeye za misile mu burasirazuba bwo hagati, ivuga ko misile zayo zo mu bwoko bwa ballistique zifite uburebure bwa kilometero zigera ku 2.000 kandi ko zishobora kugera ku birindiro byazo bya Isiraheli ndetse n'ibirindiro by’Amerika muri ako karere.
Kheibar refers to an ancient Jewish oasis in the Arabian Peninsula's Hijaz region that was overrun by Muslim warriors in the 7th century.	Kheibar bivuga oasisi ya kera y'Abayahudi yo mu gace ka Hijaz ka Arabiya y’Abarabu yigaruriwe n'abarwanyi b'Abayisilamu mu kinyejana cya 7.
Tehran regards its ballistic missile program as an important deterrent against the United States, Israel and other adversaries, and has rejected Western demands to halt it.	Tehran ibona gahunda yayo ya misile ballistique nk'ikintu gikomeye cyo gukumira Amerika, Isiraheli ndetse n'abanzi bayo, kandi yanze icyifuzo cy'iburengerazuba cyo kuyihagarika.
Over the past year, Iran and the United States have engaged in fitful, indirect talks in Vienna to revive a 2015 nuclear deal that then-President Donald Trump reneged on in 2018 and that Iran, in turn, began violating in 2019.	Mu mwaka ushize, Irani na Amerika byaganiriye na Vienne mu biganiro bifatika kandi bitaziguye kugira ngo byongere kubyutsa amasezerano ya kirimbuzi yo muri 2015 icyo gihe Perezida Donald Trump yanze kuva muri 2018 kandi ko Irani nayo yatangiye kurenga muri 2019.
Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions.	Mu masezerano ya 2015, Irani yemeye kugabanya gahunda zayo za kirimbuzi mu rwego rwo gukuraho ibihano by’ubukungu.
While they appeared close to resurrecting the deal in March, talks stalled over last-minute Russian demands and whether Washington might drop Iran's Revolutionary Guards from its Foreign Terrorist Organization list.	Mu gihe basaga nkaho bari hafi kubyutsa ayo masezerano muri Werurwe, ibiganiro byahagaritse icyifuzo cy’Uburusiya ku munota wa nyuma ndetse n’uko Washington ishobora gukuraho abashinzwe umutekano w’impinduramatwara ya Irani ku rutonde rw’umuryango w’iterabwoba w’amahanga.
As Fewer Americans Attend Church, Can Coffee Shops Fill the Void?	Nk'uko Abanyamerika bake Bajya mu Itorero, Amaduka ya Kawa Yuzuza Icyuho?
Churches and other houses of worship have historically played critical social and political functions in American society. 	Amatorero n'andi mazu asengeramo yagiye akora amateka akomeye mubikorwa bya politiki na politiki muri societe y'Abanyamerika.
But fewer people are attending religious services, and the decline of churches and other houses of worship threatens to leave a void that could potentially be filled by coffee shops.	Ariko abantu bake ni bo bitabira ibikorwa by’amadini, kandi kugabanuka kwamatorero nandi mazu yo gusengeramo bikangisha gusiga icyuho gishobora kuzuzwa n'amaduka ya kawa.
"""For so much of American history, the church has really been — or their congregations have really been — essential, providing an unheralded role in providing cohesion and connectedness in communities … encouraging civic engagement and political participation,"" says Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute."	"Umuyobozi w'ikigo, Daniel Cox agira ati: ""Mu mateka menshi y'Abanyamerika, itorero ryabaye - cyangwa amatorero yabo yabaye ngombwa - kugira uruhare rudasanzwe mu gutanga ubumwe no guhuza abaturage… gushishikariza uruhare rw'abaturage no kugira uruhare muri politiki."" Ubushakashatsi ku Buzima bw'Abanyamerika na mugenzi wawe mukuru muri American Enterprise Institute."
"""It was not happenstance or luck that the civil rights movement emerged out of the church,"" Cox says."	"Cox agira ati: ""Ntabwo byari ibintu by'uruhurirane cyangwa amahirwe kuba umuryango uharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu wavuye mu itorero."""
"""And you see that cross-culturally … whether it's in predominantly white rural communities, in the suburbs, wherever, churches have historically been really, really important."""	"""Kandi urabona ko imico itandukanye… haba mu baturage biganjemo abazungu bo mu cyaro, mu nkengero, ahantu hose, amatorero yabaye amateka mu by'ukuri, ni ngombwa."""
Churches and other houses of worship have also played a role in helping immigrants assimilate once they arrive in America, Cox says.	Cox avuga ko amatorero n'andi mazu asengeramo nabyo byagize uruhare mu gufasha abimukira kwimuka bamaze kugera muri Amerika.
In 1999, 70% of Americans said they belonged to a church, mosque or synagogue.	Mu 1999, 70% by'Abanyamerika bavuze ko bari mu rusengero, umusigiti cyangwa mu isinagogi.
By 2020, that number had dropped to 47%. A 2019 survey found that only about three in 10 Americans say they attend weekly religious services.	Muri 2020, iyo mibare yari yagabanutse kugera kuri 47%. Ubushakashatsi bwakozwe mu mwaka wa 2019 bwerekanye ko Abanyamerika bagera kuri batatu gusa ari bo bavuga ko bitabira amadini ya buri cyumweru.
"Third places Lack of involvement and affiliation with churches, mosques and synagogues means people might be missing out on what urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg dubbed as ""third places"" — public gathering spots that offer something that home, the ""first place,"" and work, the ""second place,"" might not."	"Umwanya wa gatatu Kutagira uruhare no gufatanya n'amatorero, imisigiti n'amasinagogi bivuze ko abantu bashobora kubura icyo umuhanga mubya societologue wo mumijyi Ray Oldenburg yise ""umwanya wa gatatu"" - ahantu hateranira abantu benshi batanga ikintu murugo, ""umwanya wa mbere,"" nakazi, ""umwanya wa kabiri,"" ntabwo."
Oldenburg argued that third places are critical to a communitys social vitality.	Oldenburg yavuze ko umwanya wa gatatu ari ingenzi ku mibereho y'abaturage.
An October 2021 survey conducted by the American Survey Center found that commercial spaces like coffee houses foster trust and connection in American communities and could help fill the void left by churches.	Ubushakashatsi bwakozwe mu Kwakira 2021 bwakozwe n’ikigo cy’Abanyamerika gishinzwe ubushakashatsi bwerekanye ko ahantu h’ubucuruzi nk’amazu ya kawa bitera kwizerana no guhuza imiryango y'Abanyamerika kandi bikaba byafasha kuziba icyuho cyasizwe n'amatorero.
"""If you're a regular at a cafe, the barista may know what you usually order, and they can make it for you, and that feels good,"" says clinical psychologist Dr. Maria Espinola, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine."	"Inzobere mu by'imitekerereze ya muntu, Dr. Maria Espinola, umwarimu wungirije mu ishami ry’indwara zo mu mutwe, agira ati: ""Niba usanzwe muri cafe, barista irashobora kumenya icyo usanzwe utumiza, kandi barashobora kukugukorera, kandi ibyo ni byiza."" na Neuroscience Imyitwarire muri kaminuza ya Cincinnati College of Medicine."
"""It feels good to be recognized, to know that people are expecting you, to know that people care about you, to know that you belong, because the need for belonging and human connection is a fundamental need that we all have, and it's important to have that fulfilled in different ways,"" Espinola says."	"""Ni byiza kumenyekana, kumenya ko abantu bagutegereje, kumenya ko abantu bakwitayeho, kumenya ko uri uwawe, kuko gukenera kuba hamwe no guhuza abantu nikintu cyibanze twese dufite, kandi ni ngombwa kugira ngo ibyo bisohozwe mu buryo butandukanye, ""Espinola."
"""So, places like third places can allow us to do that."""	"""Rero, ahantu nka gatatu harashobora kutwemerera kubikora."""
In the past, churches and other houses of worship have been a third place for many Americans.	Mu bihe byashize, amatorero n'andi mazu yo gusengeramo yabaye umwanya wa gatatu ku Banyamerika benshi.
In 2019, 67% of people surveyed said they have a third place — a coffee shop, bar, restaurant, park or other place in their community that they visit regularly.	Muri 2019, 67% by'abantu babajijwe bavuze ko bafite umwanya wa gatatu - iduka rya kawa, akabari, resitora, parike cyangwa ahandi hantu basura buri gihe.
That number dropped to 56% in 2021 — a number that could have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.	Umubare wagabanutse kugera kuri 56% muri 2021 - umubare washoboraga kwanduzwa nicyorezo cya COVID-19.
"""What we found was that people who had a third place were much more connected to their community,"" says Cox. ""They're much more likely to engage in other activities there."	"Cox agira ati: ""Icyo twabonye ni uko abantu bafite umwanya wa gatatu bari bahuze cyane n'abaturage babo"". ""Birashoboka cyane ko bakora ibikorwa bindi."
"They are much more trusting of their neighbors. There's a whole great array of positive social outcomes that were connected to having a third place … and for a lot of Americans, it's a coffee shop or a cafe."""	"Barizera cyane abaturanyi babo. Hano hari byinshi byiza byagezweho mu mibereho bifitanye isano no kugira umwanya wa gatatu… kandi ku Banyamerika benshi, ni ikawa cyangwa ikawa. """
What coffee shops have in their favor is that they can be found almost everywhere, all over the country, and anyone who wants to can stop by regularly.

Cox says even brief coffee shop encounters can increase a sense of belonging.	Cox avuga ko no guhura kwa kawa bigufi bishobora kongera imyumvire.
"""I think there's a lot of potential here, and a lot of it is unrealized potential,"" Cox says."	"Cox agira ati: ""Ntekereza ko hano hari byinshi bishoboka, kandi ibyinshi muri byo ntabwo bishoboka."""

What US Mayors Are Most Worried About After the Pandemic	Ibyo abayobozi ba Amerika bahangayikishijwe cyane na byo nyuma y'icyorezo
Americas mayors are most concerned about the lingering mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a nationwide survey of 126 mayors conducted during the summer of 2021.	Abayobozi ba Amerika bahangayikishijwe cyane n’ingaruka ziterwa n’ubuzima bwo mu mutwe bw’icyorezo cya COVID-19, nk’uko ubushakashatsi bwakozwe mu gihugu hose bwakorewe ku bayobozi 126 bwakozwe mu mpeshyi ya 2021.
The respondents headed cities with at least 75,000 residents. The local leaders are still focused on traditional issues such as violent crime, the economy and infrastructure, but they are most concerned about the pandemics long-term impact on the mental health of their constituents.	Ababajijwe bayoboye imijyi byibuze abaturage 75.000. Abayobozi b'inzego z'ibanze baracyibanda ku bibazo gakondo nk'ibyaha by'urugomo, ubukungu n'ibikorwa remezo, ariko bahangayikishijwe cyane n'ingaruka z'icyorezo ku buzima bwo mu mutwe bw'abatoye.
Mental health was top of mind for Michael Udine when he was sworn in as mayor of Broward County, Florida, in November 2021.	Ubuzima bwo mu mutwe bwibanze kuri Michael Udine ubwo yarahiraga kuba umuyobozi w’intara ya Broward, muri Floride, mu Gushyingo 2021.

It is not unusual for large outbreaks of disease to have a negative impact on mental health, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reports that rates of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults increased during the pandemic.	Ntibisanzwe ko icyorezo kinini cy’indwara kigira ingaruka mbi ku buzima bwo mu mutwe, nk’uko ikigo gishinzwe kurwanya no gukumira indwara kibitangaza, ngo raporo y’uko abantu bahangayitse ndetse n’indwara yo kwiheba yiyongera mu gihe cy’icyorezo.
The pandemic has also adversely influenced the emotional and mental health of about one-third of Americas youth.	Icyorezo kandi cyagize ingaruka mbi ku buzima bw'amarangamutima no mu mutwe by'urubyiruko rwo muri Amerika.
"""What we've seen is just such anxiety, kids who wouldn't ordinarily have a meltdown, because it's so much change and difficulty adjusting to transitions,"" Maryland psychologist Mary Karapetian Alvord told VOA last month.

""Twabonye kandi umubabaro mwinshi no kwiheba."""
Early on in the pandemic, mayors were more focused on city operations, budget shortfalls and the threat the pandemic posed to small businesses, according to David Glick, an associate professor of political science at Boston University and a co-author of the 2021 Menino Survey of Mayors.	Nk’uko byatangajwe na David Glick, umwarimu wungirije wa siyanse ya politiki muri kaminuza ya Boston, akaba n'umwanditsi umwe w’ubushakashatsi bwakozwe na Menino 2021, nk'uko byatangajwe na David Glick, umwarimu wungirije ushinzwe ubushakashatsi mu bya politiki, nk'uko byatangajwe na David Glick.
"""Some of those concerns still remain, but what we saw more of in 2021 … is concern about some of the long-term impacts on individual residents,"" Glick says.

Renting an apartment can be a challenge for new college graduates who are facing the hottest U.S. rental market in a decade, along with some unexpected competition from millennials — people aged 24 to 40 — and even baby boomers — the over-57 club.

There are a variety of reasons older people are opting for rentals, according to Ressler.	Hariho impamvu zitandukanye abantu bakuze bahitamo gukodesha nkuko Ressler abitangaza.

Renters are feeling the squeeze because the COVID-19 pandemic caused supply chain issues, slowing down home building in the United States. 	Abakodesha bumva bahungabanye kuko icyorezo cya COVID-19 cyateje ibibazo byo gutanga amasoko, bidindiza inyubako zamazu muri Amerika.
Instead of the usual 5-to-6 month supply of available single-family homes, supply dropped below two months in January 2021. 	Aho kugirango amezi 5 kugeza 6 asanzwe atange amazu yumuryango umwe, itangwa ryagabanutse munsi yamezi abiri muri Mutarama 2021.
The lack of housing supply means millennials are having a harder time buying a single-family home, which has been the traditional trajectory in the past.	Kubura amazu yo guturamo bivuze ko imyaka igihumbi igira ikibazo cyo kugura inzu yumuryango umwe, wahoze ari inzira gakondo mugihe cyashize.
"""The whole building industry was beset by supply chain issues,"" Cororaton says. "	"Cororaton agira ati: ""Inganda zose zubaka zari zugarijwe n'ibibazo bitangwa."""

The housing supply got even tighter during the pandemic as more investors put their money into housing, according to Cororaton, while existing homeowners looked for second homes.	Itangwa ry'amazu ryarushijeho kwiyongera mu gihe cy'icyorezo kuko abashoramari benshi bashyira amafaranga yabo mu mazu nk'uko Cororaton abitangaza, mu gihe ba nyir'amazu bariho bashakisha amazu ya kabiri.

"""There are a lot of reasons to believe that kids need to be exposed to things to keep their immunity complex, so that should they encounter something very dangerous, they have aspects of their immunity that might cross over and help protect them against those things,"" says Sara Sawyer, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Colorado Boulder."	Hariho impamvu nyinshi zituma twemera ko abana bakeneye guhura nibintu kugirango bagumane ubudahangarwa bwabo, kuburyo nibaramuka bahuye nikintu kibi cyane, bafite ingingo zubudahangarwa bwabo zishobora kwambuka zikabafasha kubarinda ibyo bintu, ibi bikaba byavuzwe na Sara Sawyer, umwarimu w’ibinyabuzima bya molekuline, selile n’iterambere muri kaminuza ya Colorado Boulder.
At birth, vulnerable infants get antibodies from their mothers breast milk, which helps protect them until they can build their own immunity.	Mu gihe cyo kuvuka, impinja zitagira kivurira zibona antibodi kuri ba nyina amashereka, abafasha kubarinda kugeza igihe bazubaka ubudahangarwa bwabo.
Its no accident that babies start putting things in their mouths as soon as they gain enough dexterity to pick things up. 	Ntabwo ari impanuka ko abana batangira gushyira ibintu mu munwa bakimara kugira ubuhanga buhagije bwo gutoragura ibintu.

Even before the pandemic, epidemiological evidence suggested that children in more developed countries, where handwashing and the use of sanitizer are more prevalent, might have less-developed immune systems compared to kids in developing nations who are routinely exposed to more bacteria, viruses and allergens.

US Quietly Expands Asylum Limits While Preparing to End Them	Amerika Yaguye Bituje Imipaka Yubuhunzi Mugihe Yitegura Kubarangiza
The Biden administration has begun expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans to Mexico under pandemic-related powers to deny migrants a chance to seek asylum, expanding use of the rule even as it publicly says it has been trying to unwind it, officials said Wednesday.	Ku wa gatatu, abayobozi bavuze ko ubuyobozi bwa Biden bwatangiye kwirukana Abanyakanani na Nikaragwa muri Mexico kubera ububasha bujyanye n’icyorezo bwo kwima abimukira amahirwe yo gusaba ubuhungiro, kwagura ikoreshwa ry’iryo tegeko nubwo rivuga ku mugaragaro ko ryagerageje kubireka.
The U.S. struck agreement with Mexico to expel up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans a day from three locations: San Diego; El Paso, Texas; and Rio Grande Valley, Texas, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the effort.	Amerika yagiranye amasezerano na Mexico yo kwirukana abanya Cuba 100 na Nikaragwa 20 kumunsi ahantu hatatu: San Diego; El Paso, muri Texas; n'ikibaya cya Rio Grande, muri Texas, nk'uko byatangajwe n'umuyobozi wa Amerika ufite ubumenyi butaziguye bw'imbaraga.
The expulsions began April 27 and will end May 22, the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the agreement has not been made public.	Iyirukanwa ryatangiye ku ya 27 Mata rikazarangira ku ya 22 Gicurasi, nk'uko uyu muyobozi yabitangarije ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abanyamerika kugira ngo atamenyekana kubera ko ayo masezerano atashyizwe ahagaragara.
They are carried out under Title 42 authority, a public health law that has been used to expel migrants on grounds of preventing spread of COVID-19. Title 42 is due to expire May 23, unless a judge intervenes.	Bikorerwa munsi yumutwe wa 42, itegeko ryubuzima rusange ryakoreshejwe mu kwirukana abimukira ku mpamvu zo gukumira ikwirakwizwa rya COVID-19. Umutwe wa 42 ugomba kurangira ku ya 23 Gicurasi, keretse umucamanza abigizemo uruhare.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed April 26 to a very limited number of expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans, according to a high-level Mexican official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.	Nk’uko byatangajwe n'umuyobozi wo mu rwego rwo hejuru wo muri Megizike wavuze ko atigeze atangazwa kubera ko batemerewe kugira icyo batangaza ku mugaragaro, Amerika na Mexico byumvikanye ku ya 26 Mata ku mubare muto cyane wo kwirukana Abanyakanani na Nikaragwa.
It was prompted by higher numbers of migrants from those two countries coming to the U.S. border.	Byatewe numubare munini w’abimukira bava muri ibyo bihugu byombi baza kumupaka wa Amerika.
Mexico also took into account that the U.S. government had started processing visas in Cuba again, the official said. Mexico had also begun processing visas for Cubans.	Uyu muyobozi yavuze ko Mexico kandi yazirikanye ko guverinoma y'Amerika yatangiye gutunganya viza muri Cuba. Mexico nayo yari yatangiye gutunganya viza kubanya Cuba.
Another Mexican official, also not authorized to comment publicly, confirmed that up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans were being expelled from San Diego under Title 42.	Undi muyobozi wo muri Megizike, na we utemerewe kugira icyo atangaza ku mugaragaro, yemeje ko Abanyakanani bagera kuri 100 na Nikaragwa 20 birukanwa muri San Diego ku mutwe wa 42.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	Minisiteri ishinzwe umutekano mu gihugu cya Amerika ntabwo yahise isubiza icyifuzo cyo gutanga ibisobanuro.
Until last week, Mexico only agreed to take Guatemalans, Hondurans and El Salvadorans — in addition to Mexicans — under Title 42 authority. Other nationalities are subject to Title 42 but costs, strained diplomatic ties and other considerations often make it difficult to send them back to their home countries.	Kugeza mu cyumweru gishize, Mexico yemeye gufata Guatemala, Hondurans na El Salvadorans - usibye Abanyamegizike - ku butegetsi bwa 42. Abandi benegihugu bagengwa na Umutwe wa 42 ariko ikiguzi, umubano wububanyi n’ububanyi n’ibindi bitekerezo akenshi biragoye kubasubiza mu bihugu byabo.
It's next to impossible for the U.S. to expel migrants to Cuba or Nicaragua because of poor relations with those governments. 	Bikurikira ntibishoboka ko Amerika yirukana abimukira muri Cuba cyangwa Nikaragwa kubera umubano mubi na guverinoma.
That has posed a challenge for the Biden administration as more people from those countries seek haven in the United States.	Ibyo byateje ikibazo ubuyobozi bwa Biden mugihe abantu benshi baturuka muri ibyo bihugu bashaka ubuhungiro muri Amerika.
Cubans were stopped by U.S. authorities more than 32,000 times on the Mexican border in March, double the number in February and more than five times October's count, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Nicaragua eased travel restrictions from Cuba in November, making it easier for Cubans to continue by land to the U.S. border. Most enter the U.S. in or near Yuma, Arizona, and Del Rio, Texas.	Nk’uko byatangajwe na gasutamo ya Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika, ngo abanya Cuba bahagaritswe n'abayobozi b'Abanyamerika inshuro zirenga 32.000 ku mupaka wa Mexico, bakubye kabiri muri Gashyantare ndetse bakubye inshuro zirenga eshanu Ukwakira. Nikaragwa yorohereje imbogamizi z’ingendo ziva muri Cuba mu Gushyingo, byorohereza Abanyakanada gukomeza ku butaka kugera ku mupaka wa Amerika. Benshi binjira muri Amerika cyangwa hafi ya Yuma, Arizona, na Del Rio, Texas.
Nicaraguans were stopped more than 16,000 times in March, more than double September's level. The vast majority enter in South Texas.	Muri Werurwe, Nikaragwa yahagaritswe inshuro zirenga 16.000, irenga inshuro ebyiri Nzeri. Umubare munini winjira muri Texas yepfo.
Lifting Title 42 has proved controversial as midterm elections near, even for Biden's Democratic Party, amid concerns that the U.S. is unprepared for an anticipated increase in migrants seeking asylum. Authorities stopped migrants more than 221,000 times in March, the highest mark in 22 years.	Kuzamura Umutwe wa 42 byagaragaye ko bitavugwaho rumwe nk’amatora yo hagati, ndetse no mu ishyaka rya demokarasi rya Biden, mu gihe hari impungenge z’uko Amerika ititeguye kwiyongera kw’abimukira bashaka ubuhungiro. Muri Werurwe, abategetsi bahagaritse abimukira inshuro zirenga 221.000, kikaba aricyo kintu kinini mu myaka 22.
The White House and Homeland Security Department have publicly stood behind the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision to end the measure because it could no longer be justified on grounds of protecting public health.	Ishami ry’umutekano n’umutekano mu gihugu ryashyigikiye ku mugaragaro icyemezo cy’ikigo gishinzwe kurwanya no gukumira indwara cyo guhagarika iki cyemezo kuko kitagishoboye kuba gifite ishingiro kubera kurengera ubuzima rusange.
But the practice of expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans runs counter to the administration's public statements that it was phasing out use of the pandemic powers to prepare for May 23.	Ariko imyitozo yo kwirukana abanya Cuba na Nikaragwa irahabanye n’ubuyobozi bwatangaje ko bwagiye bukuraho imbaraga z’icyorezo kugira ngo bitegure ku ya 23 Gicurasi.
The U.S. has expelled migrants more than 1.8 million times under Title 42 authority since March 2020, effectively overriding rights to seek asylum under U.S. law and international treaty. In doing so, migrants are not subject to immigration law, which include rights to seek protection from persecution at home.	Kuva muri Werurwe 2020, Amerika yirukanye abimukira inshuro zirenga miliyoni 1.8 ku butegetsi bwa Umutwe wa 42, bivuguruza uburenganzira bwo gusaba ubuhungiro hakurikijwe amategeko ya Amerika n'amasezerano mpuzamahanga. Mu kubikora, abimukira ntibagengwa n'amategeko y’abinjira, akubiyemo uburenganzira bwo kurindwa ibitotezo mu ngo.
The administration said in court filings that it began processing more Central American adults under immigration laws after the CDC's announcement on April 1. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that it couldn't start unwinding Title 42 while it was still in effect.	Ubuyobozi bwatangaje mu rukiko ko bwatangiye gutunganya abantu benshi bakuze bo muri Amerika yo Hagati bakurikiza amategeko y’abinjira nyuma y’uko CDC ibitangaza ku ya 1 Mata.
U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays strongly criticized the CDC's decision, suggesting he would try to keep Title 42 in effect after May 23. A hearing is scheduled May 13 for oral arguments.	Umucamanza w'akarere ka Amerika, Robert Summerhays, yanenze cyane icyemezo cya CDC, avuga ko azagerageza gukomeza Umutwe wa 42 nyuma y'itariki ya 23 Gicurasi.
Marisa Limon, senior director of advocacy and planning at the Hope Border Institute, said advocates began learning about expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans from El Paso on Monday and later confirmed the new practice with U.S. officials.	Umuyobozi mukuru ushinzwe ubuvugizi n’igenamigambi mu kigo cya Hope Border, Marisa Limon, yavuze ko abunganizi batangiye kwiga ibijyanye no kwirukana Abanyakanani na Nikaragwa muri El Paso ku wa mbere nyuma baza kwemeza imikorere mishya hamwe n’abayobozi ba Amerika.
"Limon said the administration is ""trying to get every last bit out of Title 42"" before it expires. "	"Limon yavuze ko ubuyobozi ""bugerageza gukuramo buri kintu cya nyuma mu mutwe wa 42"" kitararangira."
"She called it ""sobering"" but consistent with the administration's efforts to have other countries in the Western hemisphere take more responsibility for hosting people fleeing their homes."	"Yayise ""gutekereza"" ariko ahuza n'imbaraga z'ubuyobozi kugira ngo ibindi bihugu byo mu gice cy'iburengerazuba bigire uruhare runini mu kwakira abantu bahunga ingo zabo."
Mexico Relocates Migrant Camp; Haitians Appear at Border	Mexico yimuye inkambi y'abimukira; Abanyahayitiya bagaragara kumupaka
Mexican authorities said Tuesday they have relocated a migrant camp that sprung up in a park in the border city of Reynosa, moving about 2,000 people from Central America and Haiti to a shelter in the city, across the border from McAllen, Texas.	Ku wa kabiri, abategetsi ba Mexico bavuze ko bimuye inkambi y’abimukira yavukiye muri parike iri mu mujyi wa Reynosa uhana imbibi, yimura abantu bagera ku 2000 bava muri Amerika yo Hagati na Haiti mu buhungiro mu mujyi, hakurya y’umupaka na McAllen, muri Texas.
The camp of migrants mainly from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti sprung up after U.S. officials, citing the pandemic, invoked a health rule that denies migrants a chance to seek asylum.	Inkambi y'abimukira ahanini baturutse muri Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras na Haiti imaze kuvuka nyuma yuko abayobozi ba Amerika, bavuga ko iki cyorezo, basabye itegeko ry’ubuzima ryanga abimukira amahirwe yo gusaba ubuhungiro.
Mexico's National Immigration Institute said the migrants were taken around midnight Monday to the shelter, which it said will have better hygiene and food services.	Ikigo cy'igihugu gishinzwe abinjira n'abasohoka muri Mexico cyatangaje ko abimukira bajyanywe mu gicuku cyo ku wa mbere bakajya mu buhungiro, buvuga ko buzagira isuku na serivisi nziza.
But on Monday, people in another border city, Nuevo Laredo, said hundreds of migrants, mainly Haitians, have streamed into that city, which is across the border from Laredo, Texas	Ariko ku wa mbere, abantu bo mu wundi mujyi uhana imbibi, Nuevo Laredo, bavuze ko abimukira babarirwa mu magana, cyane cyane Abanyahayiti, binjiye muri uwo mujyi, uhana imbibi na Laredo, muri Texas.
The rush apparently started after the U.S. began processing some asylum-seekers there.	Kwihuta bigaragara ko byatangiye nyuma yuko Amerika itangiye gutunganya bamwe mubasaba ubuhungiro.
The Catholic bishop of Nuevo Laredo said Monday that migrant shelters there are overcrowded, with some migrants sleeping outside in tents.	Umwepiskopi gatolika wa Nuevo Laredo yavuze ku wa mbere ko aho abimukira bahurira huzuye, aho abimukira bamwe baryama hanze mu mahema.
Bishop Enrique Sánchez Martínez said migrants started streaming into Nuevo Laredo in late April, though the city isn't usually popular among migrants, in part because it is dominated by the violent Northeast drug cartel.	Musenyeri Enrique Sánchez Martínez yavuze ko abimukira batangiye kwinjira muri Nuevo Laredo mu mpera za Mata, nubwo uyu mujyi udakunzwe cyane n'abimukira, kubera ko wiganjemo amakarito y’ibiyobyabwenge yo mu majyaruguru y'uburasirazuba.
"""It is new for us because this is the last place they come, due to the conditions of our border, of our city, which are sometimes adverse for migrants,"" the bishop said. "	"Umwepiskopi yagize ati: ""Ni shyashya kuri twe kuko aha niho hantu ha nyuma baza, bitewe n'imipaka yacu, umujyi wacu, rimwe na rimwe bikaba bibi ku bimukira."""
"""But since they opened the door in the United States to asylum requests, a lot of them came in large groups."""	"""Ariko kuva bafungura umuryango muri Amerika gusaba ubuhunzi, benshi muri bo baza mu matsinda manini."""
Marvin Ajic, the director of the Casa Nazareth shelter, said that around April 16, Mexican authorities notified the shelters that the United States would resume processing asylum claims for humanitarian reasons.	Umuyobozi w'ikigo cya Casa Nazareth, Marvin Ajic, yavuze ko ahagana ku ya 16 Mata, abategetsi ba Mexico bamenyesheje ubwo buhungiro ko Amerika izakomeza gutunganya ibirego by'ubuhunzi kubera impamvu z’ubutabazi.
The U.S. had begun allowing more people in, especially Central American adults, to prepare for lifting Title 42 — a pandemic-era health rule that denies migrants a chance to enter the U.S. seek asylum — on May 23. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that the government could not unwind the rule before the end date.	Ku ya 23 Gicurasi, Amerika yari yatangiye kwemerera abantu benshi, cyane cyane abakuze bo muri Amerika yo Hagati, kwitegura gukuraho Umutwe wa 42 - itegeko ry’ubuzima bwo mu gihe cy’icyorezo kibuza abimukira amahirwe yo kwinjira muri Amerika gusaba ubuhungiro - ku ya 23 Gicurasi. Ariko umucamanza wa federasiyo muri Louisiana yemeje icyumweru gishize ko guverinoma idashobora gukuraho iryo tegeko mbere yitariki yo kurangiriraho.
"""The (Mexican) immigration officials organized things with the shelters, and the plan was to send people who had been waiting a long time, without any checks, basically anyone,"" Ajic said."	"Ajic yagize ati: ""Abashinzwe abinjira n'abasohoka (Abanyamegizike) bateguye ibintu hamwe n'ubuhungiro, kandi gahunda yari iyo kohereza abantu bari bategereje igihe kirekire, nta sheki bafite, cyane cyane umuntu uwo ari we wese."""
That apparently drew the attention of other migrants, including Haitians.	Ikigaragara ni uko ibyo byashimishije abandi bimukira, harimo n'Abanyahayiti.
In September, similar rumors sparked a rush by about 15,000 mostly Haitian refugees to the Texas border, where they camped under a bridge. U.S. officials began large scale deportations of Haitians while also allowing thousands to remain in the U.S.	Muri Nzeri, ibihuha nk'ibyo byatumye abantu bagera ku 15.000 bihutira cyane cyane impunzi zo muri Hayiti kugera ku mupaka wa Texas, aho bakambitse munsi y'ikiraro. Abayobozi ba Amerika batangiye kwirukana Abanyahayiti benshi mu gihe banemerera ibihumbi kuguma muri Amerika
Ajic warned migrants against coming to the border, noting the risks. On Monday, Mexico's National Immigration Institute said that so far this year, it has pulled the bodies of 19 immigrants from the Rio Grande, also known as the Rio Bravo.	Ajic yihanangirije abimukira kwirinda kuza ku mupaka, avuga ingaruka. Ku wa mbere, Ikigo cy’igihugu gishinzwe abinjira n’abasohoka muri Mexico cyavuze ko kugeza uyu mwaka, kimaze gukuramo imirambo y’abimukira 19 bava muri Rio Grande, izwi kandi ku izina rya Rio Bravo.
New US Rule Grants Automatic Work Permit Extensions to Noncitizens	Amategeko mashya yo muri Amerika atanga uruhushya rwo gukora rwikora kubaturage
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced Tuesday that it would automatically extend for 360 days the work permits of immigrants who applied to renew their work authorization amid the current backlog in processing times.	Serivisi ishinzwe abenegihugu n’abinjira n’abasohoka muri Amerika (USCIS) yatangaje ku wa kabiri ko izahita yongerwa iminsi 360 uruhushya rwo gukora rw’abimukira basabye kuvugurura uruhushya rw’akazi mu gihe kiri inyuma mu gihe cyo gutunganya.
The new notice expands on the 180-day extension USCIS announced in November. It is expected to prevent about 260,000 immigrants from losing their work permits in the next 18 months. It will also give the agency extra time to clear applicants waiting in line, the agency said in a statement.	Amatangazo mashya yagutse ku iyongerwa ry'iminsi 180 USCIS yatangaje mu Gushyingo. Biteganijwe ko bizabuza abimukira bagera ku 260.000 gutakaza uruhushya rwo gukora mu mezi 18 ari imbere. Bizatanga kandi ikigo cy’inyongera cyo gukuraho abasaba gutegereza umurongo, nkuko byatangajwe n’ikigo.
"""This temporary rule will provide those noncitizens otherwise eligible for the automatic extension an opportunity to maintain employment and provide critical support for their families while avoiding further disruption for U.S. employers,"" USCIS Director Ur M. Jaddou said in a statement."	"Mu ijambo rye, Umuyobozi wa USCIS, Ur M. Jaddou, yagize ati: ""Iri tegeko ry’agateganyo rizaha abo banyagihugu ubundi bemerewe kongererwa mu buryo bwikora amahirwe yo gukomeza akazi no gutanga inkunga ikomeye ku miryango yabo mu gihe birinda ko hajyaho ihungabana ku bakoresha ba Amerika."""
The extension, which takes effect Wednesday, aims to stabilize operations for U.S. employers and help people with pending employment authorizations who have a job and are working in the U.S.	Iyongerekana ritangira gukurikizwa ku wa gatatu, rigamije guhuza ibikorwa ku bakoresha ba Amerika no gufasha abantu bafite uburenganzira bwo gutegereza bafite akazi kandi bakorera muri Amerika.
USCIS is the agency in charge of handling the nation's immigration paperwork. In recent years, it has struggled with backlogs, an issue made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic and budget shortfalls.	USCIS nicyo kigo gishinzwe gukemura impapuro z’abinjira mu gihugu. Mu myaka yashize, yahanganye n'ibibazo bidasubirwaho, ikibazo cyarushijeho kuba icyorezo cya COVID-19 hamwe no kubura ingengo yimari.
In April, Jaddou told U.S. government officials during a congressional hearing that USCIS had 8.5 million pending immigration cases, including those seeking green cards and U.S. naturalization.	Muri Mata, Jaddou yabwiye abayobozi ba leta zunze ubumwe z’Amerika mu gihe cy’iburanisha ry’inteko ishinga amategeko ko USCIS ifite miliyoni 8.5 zitegereje imanza z’abinjira n’abinjira, harimo n’abashaka amakarita y’icyatsi ndetse n’ubwenegihugu bwa Amerika.
She said more than half of those pending cases were taking longer than the agency's normal processing times.	Yavuze ko kimwe cya kabiri cy’izo manza zitarangizwa zafashe igihe kirenze igihe cy’ikigo gisanzwe.
Asylum-seekers, immigrants adjusting their status to permanent residence and other noncitizens going through the U.S. immigration process are among the noncitizens affected by the latest work authorization extension.	Abasaba ubuhungiro, abimukira bahindura status yabo gutura burundu hamwe nabandi banyagihugu banyura muri gahunda y’abinjira n’abanyamerika bari mu baturage badafite ingaruka ku iyongerwa ry’akazi riheruka.
The agency had reported that processing times for asylum applicants looking to renew work permits increased from seven months in 2017 to 11 months in 2021.	Ikigo cyari cyatangaje ko igihe cyo gutunganya abasaba ubuhunzi bashaka kuvugurura impushya zo gukora cyiyongereye kuva ku mezi arindwi muri 2017 kigera ku mezi 11 muri 2021.
In March, USCIS announced a program to reduce backlogs, including the expansion of premium processing for certain applications where applicants could pay a higher fee to expedite paperwork processing.	Muri Werurwe, USCIS yatangaje gahunda yo kugabanya ibirarane, harimo no kwagura progaramu ya progaramu ya progaramu zimwe aho abasaba bashobora kwishyura amafaranga menshi kugirango byihutishe gutunganya impapuro.
According to the USCIS, most of the announced changes simply restore options offered before the Trump administration's slowdown of USCIS processing and before the COVID-19 pandemic further slowed the agency's resources.	Nk’uko USCIS ibigaragaza, impinduka nyinshi zatangajwe gusa zigarura gusa amahitamo yatanzwe mbere y’uko ubuyobozi bwa Trump butinda gutunganya USCIS ndetse na mbere y’icyorezo cya COVID-19 cyadindije umutungo w’ikigo.
"""For several years, USCIS has been in a precarious financial situation that has impaired the efficient completion of caseloads."	Hashize imyaka itari mike, USCIS ihura n'ikibazo cy'ubukungu cyabujije kurangiza neza amakarito.
The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these challenges in 2020, in addition to a hiring freeze and furlough threat leading to workforce attrition and severely reduced capacity. 	Icyorezo cya COVID-19 cyakajije umurego muri 2020, hiyongereyeho gukonjesha akazi no gukangisha abantu bigatuma abakozi binjira kandi bikagabanya cyane ubushobozi.
"In 2021, before USCIS could recover from these fiscal and operational impacts, there was a sudden and dramatic increase in EAD (Employment Authorization Document) initial and renewal filings,"" according to the USCIS statement."	Mu 2021, mbere yuko USCIS isubirana izo ngaruka z’imari n’ibikorwa, habaye ubwiyongere butunguranye kandi butangaje muri EAD (Impapuro zemeza akazi) inyandiko zambere kandi zivugururwa , nk'uko byatangajwe na USCIS.
The USCIS historically has been underfunded because most of the agency's funding comes from application fees that have stalled at $5 billion a year since 2019.	Amateka ya USCIS yatewe inkunga kubera ko inkunga nyinshi z’ikigo zituruka ku mafaranga yo gusaba yahagaze kuri miliyari 5 z'amadolari ku mwaka kuva 2019.

What about those arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border?	Tuvuge iki ku bashitse ku mupaka wa Amerika na Mexico?
Citing safety issues, U.S. officials have urged Ukrainians not to travel to Mexico in hopes of entering the United States. In addition, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has no place to hold them while they go through the Uniting for Ukraine vetting process.

Biden officials hope this will curb the number of Ukrainian migrants seeking humanitarian parole along the border.	Abayobozi ba Biden bizeye ko ibyo bizagabanya umubare w’abimukira bo muri Ukraine bashaka gufungurwa by’umupaka.
Those at the border must apply under the rules of Uniting for Ukraine, meaning they must have a qualifying sponsor or a non-government agency willing to sponsor them in the U.S. for up to two years.

Abari ku mipaka bagomba gusaba hakurikijwe amategeko agenga ubumwe bwa Ukraine, bivuze ko bagomba kugira umuterankunga wujuje ibyangombwa cyangwa ikigo kitegamiye kuri leta cyifuza kubatera inkunga muri Amerika mugihe cyimyaka ibiri. Kandi bakeneye kugira inkingo zose zisabwa no gutsinda igenzura.
The Biden administration announced the private sponsorship initiative as another way the U.S. hopes to achieve President Biden's commitment to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians displaced by the Russian military invasion.

Report: Rwanda Should Ease Restrictions On 2003 National Elections - 2001-10-15	Raporo: U Rwanda rukwiye koroshya imbogamizi ku matora y’igihugu 2003 - 2001-10-15
In 2003 Rwanda will hold its first national elections since the 1994 genocide. A new report says the government of Rwanda needs to relax its control over public life if the polls are to have any credibility.	Mu 2003 u Rwanda ruzakora amatora yambere y’igihugu kuva jenoside yo mu 1994. Raporo nshya ivuga ko guverinoma y'u Rwanda ikeneye koroshya ubuzima bw’abaturage niba amatora agomba kwizerwa.
There was relief when the Rwandan Patriotic Front seized power in Rwanda in 1994, ending the genocide in which about 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.	Habayeho ihumure igihe urugamba rwo gukunda igihugu rw’u Rwanda rwafataga ubutegetsi mu Rwanda mu 1994, rukarangiza itsembabwoko ryahitanye Abatutsi bagera ku 800.000 n'Abahutu bashyira mu gaciro.
The new military government promised to restore democracy to Rwanda via elections in 2003.	Guverinoma nshya y’ingabo yasezeranije kugarura demokarasi mu Rwanda binyuze mu matora yo mu 2003.
That process began in March this year, with district elections.	Iyo nzira yatangiye muri Werurwe uyu mwaka, hamwe n’amatora y’akarere.
Senior analyst Francois Grignon, of the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based policy research organization, says he was disappointed with the district poll. Mr. Grignon says the process was so tightly controlled that he maintains no genuine opposition candidates were allowed to stand.	Umusesenguzi mukuru Francois Grignon, wo mu itsinda mpuzamahanga rishinzwe ibibazo bya politiki iherereye i Buruseli, avuga ko yatengushye amatora y'akarere. Bwana Grignon avuga ko inzira yagenzuwe cyane ku buryo akomeza avuga ko nta bakandida nyabo batavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi bari bemerewe guhagarara.
"""There was a screening and there was a preparation of the elections, which did not allow other candidates than those who had been rubber-stamped by the government to actually contest, especially for the executive positions within the local authorities,"" he says. ""If consensual democracy means that the political debate is actually handled before the electoral contest in such a way that it does not lead to a real competition then there is no democracy at all."""	"Agira ati: ""Habayeho isuzuma kandi hategurwa amatora, atemerera abandi bakandida uretse abashyizweho kashe na guverinoma guhatanira koko, cyane cyane ku myanya y'ubuyobozi mu nzego z'ibanze"". ""Niba demokarasi yumvikanyweho bivuze ko impaka za politiki zikemurwa mbere y'amarushanwa y'amatora ku buryo bitatuma habaho amarushanwa nyayo, nta demokarasi ihari."""
In a new report, titled Consensual Democracy in Post Genocide Rwanda, the International Crisis Group urges the international community to pressure Rwanda's government to liberalize political activity.	Muri raporo nshya yiswe Demokarasi ihuriweho na Jenoside nyuma y’itsembabwoko mu Rwanda, Itsinda mpuzamahanga rishinzwe ibibazo rirasaba amahanga guhatira leta y’u Rwanda kwishyira ukizana mu bikorwa bya politiki.
The report notes that the military dominates public life and there is little open criticism of the government, either in the media or by opposition figures. The Rwanda government argues that allowing a range of opinions would be dangerous in a country struggling to come to terms with its bloody past.	Raporo ivuga ko igisirikare cyiganje mu buzima rusange kandi ko nta kunegura guverinoma, haba mu bitangazamakuru cyangwa ku bantu batavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi. Guverinoma y'u Rwanda ivuga ko kwemerera ibitekerezo bitandukanye byaba ari akaga mu gihugu kirwanira kumvikana na kahise kayo k'amaraso.
But Mr. Grignon says dissent is simply being driven underground or outside Rwanda's borders.	Ariko Bwana Grignon avuga ko abatavuga rumwe na leta bayoborwa mu nsi cyangwa hanze y’umupaka w’u Rwanda.
"""Opponents to the regime have to flee the country or to join in rebel movements outside the country or in the Congo and no chance to express a different view,"" he says. ""All the good policies that the government has been implementing - including the organization of the elections, national elections, presidential and parliamentary, in 2003 - will lack the credibility because they were not implemented in an environment that actually allowed a fair contest to take place,"" he says."	"Agira ati: ""Abatavuga rumwe n'ubutegetsi bagomba guhunga igihugu cyangwa kujya mu myigaragambyo y'inyeshyamba hanze y'igihugu cyangwa muri Kongo kandi nta mahirwe yo kuvuga ukundi."" ""Politiki nziza zose guverinoma yashyize mu bikorwa - harimo gutegura amatora, amatora y’igihugu, perezida ndetse n’inteko ishinga amategeko, mu 2003 - ntizizigirirwa icyizere kuko zitashyizwe mu bikorwa byemerera amarushanwa akwiye. , ""."
Mr. Grignon says greater freedom of expression would strengthen Rwanda's reconciliation process and enhance its chances of a peaceful future.	Bwana Grignon avuga ko ubwisanzure mu gutanga ibitekerezo bwashimangira inzira y'ubwiyunge y'u Rwanda kandi bikongerera amahirwe y'ejo hazaza.
He says the international community's involvement in reconstruction projects gives it the leverage to make this plain to the Rwandan government.	Avuga ko uruhare mpuzamahanga mu mishinga yo kwiyubaka rutanga imbaraga zo kugeza iki kibazo kuri guverinoma y'u Rwanda.
Economists Predict Bumpy Road for Malawi's Economy in 2015	Abahanga mu bukungu bavuze ku muhanda wa Bumpy mu bukungu bwa Malawi muri 2015
Economists in Malawi say the country is likely to continue facing financial challenges in 2015 unless the government can regain the confidence of donors, who are still withholding 40 percent of budgetary support due to the corruption scandal known as Cashgate. More than $30 million were looted from government coffers in the scandal, and several people, including government officials, were arrested.	Abashinzwe ubukungu muri Malawi bavuga ko iki gihugu gishobora gukomeza guhura n’ibibazo by’amafaranga mu mwaka wa 2015 keretse guverinoma ishobora kugarura ikizere cy’abaterankunga, bakaba bakomeje guhagarika 40% by’ingengo y’imari kubera ikibazo cya ruswa kizwi ku izina rya Cashgate. Amadolari arenga miliyoni 30 yasahuwe mu isanduku ya leta muri ayo mahano, maze abantu benshi barimo n'abayobozi ba leta barafatwa.
The withholding of donor aid has forced Malawi's government to pass what is known as the Zero Aid national budget for the 2014-2015 fiscal year. Analysts, such as Abel Mwanyungwe, an economics lecturer at the Polytechnic College of the University of Malawi, say the drop in spending has hurt the economy.	Guhagarika imfashanyo z'abaterankunga byatumye leta ya Malawi itora icyitwa ingengo y’imari ya Zero Aid mu mwaka w'ingengo y'imari wa 2014-2015. Abasesenguzi nka Abel Mwanyungwe, umwarimu w’ubukungu muri kaminuza ya Polytechnic ya kaminuza ya Malawi, bavuga ko igabanuka ry’amafaranga ryangije ubukungu.
"""This has been a bumpy year as we are coming from the Cashgate effects that have quite a major dent on the economys performance. We have seen that in most cases the very delicate and crucial departments and service providers have been affected, in the sense that we dont have enough drugs in the hospitals. In schools, in terms of teachers payments is not in time,"" said Mwanyungwe."	Uyu ni umwaka utoroshye kuko tuvuye mu ngaruka za Cashgate zifite uruhare runini mu mikorere y'ubukungu. Twabonye ko akenshi usanga amashami yoroheje kandi akomeye ndetse n'abatanga serivisi byagize ingaruka, mu buryo bw'uko ntabwo dufite ibiyobyabwenge bihagije mu bitaro. Mu mashuri, mu bijyanye no kwishyura abarimu ntabwo ari igihe , Mwanyungwe.
Mwanyungwe also links Cashgate to the recent depreciation of Malawis currency, the kwacha, which has resulted in strikes by various government workers demanding higher pay.	Mwanyungwe ahuza kandi Cashgate no guta agaciro kw'ifaranga rya Malawis, kwacha, bikaba byaratumye imyigaragambyo y'abakozi ba leta basaba umushahara munini.
For example, support staff for the judiciary have been on strike for six weeks, seeking a 45 percent pay increase which the government says it cannot afford because it has no money.	Kurugero, abakozi bunganira ubucamanza bamaze ibyumweru bitandatu bigaragambyaga, basaba kongererwa umushahara 45% leta ivuga ko idashobora kwishyura kuko idafite amafaranga.
Workers at Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau went on strike demanding a 70 percent pay raise until the government threatened to forfeit their December salaries if they did not return.	Abakozi bo mu biro bishinzwe kurwanya ruswa muri Malawi bagiye mu myigaragambyo basaba kongererwa umushahara 70% kugeza igihe leta ibangamiye ko bazabura umushahara wabo mu Kuboza nibataha.
Mwanyungwe said the government can only avoid further strikes in 2015 if it makes efforts to restore donor confidence in the management of its public finances.	Mwanyungwe yavuze ko guverinoma ishobora kwirinda gusa imyigaragambyo mu 2015 mu gihe ishyira ingufu mu kugarura icyizere cy'abaterankunga mu micungire y’imari ya Leta.
"""My fear is that if we dont have this donor confidence and donor support coming back to the economy, we may force the government to go into serious local borrowing that would lead to serious repercussions in terms of inflation, in terms of interest rates and this may have a sort of catch-catch lose situation,"" said Mwanyungwe."	Ubwoba bwanjye ni uko niba tudafite iki cyizere cy'abaterankunga ndetse n'inkunga y'abaterankunga igaruka mu bukungu, dushobora guhatira guverinoma kujya mu nguzanyo zikomeye zaho byavamo ingaruka zikomeye ku bijyanye n'ifaranga, ku bijyanye n'inyungu n'ibi hashobora kugira uburyo bwo gufata-gutakaza ibintu , Mwanyungwe.
The donors are, among other things, demanding that the government prosecute all those involved in the scandal and strengthen its financial management system.	Abaterankunga, mu bindi, basaba ko leta yakurikirana abantu bose bagize uruhare muri ayo mahano no gushimangira gahunda y’imicungire y’imari.
"Newton Kambala, the president of the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the scandal rendered 2014 as ""a very bad year for the business sector, because of huge debts that the government owes the private sector."""	"Newton Kambala, perezida w’ishyirahamwe ry’ubucuruzi n’inganda muri Malawi, yavuze ko aya mahano yatumye umwaka wa 2014 uba ""umwaka mubi cyane ku bucuruzi, kubera imyenda nini leta ibereyemo abikorera."""
"He warned that if the situation persists, ""2015 will be worse."""	"Yagabishije ko nibikomeza, ""2015 bizaba bibi."""
In his state of the nation address last Saturday, Malawi president Peter Mutharika said his government is doing everything possible to address the problems caused by the Cashgate scandal.	Ku wa gatandatu ushize, muri leta y’igihugu cye, Peter Mutharika, yavuze ko guverinoma ye ikora ibishoboka byose kugira ngo ikemure ibibazo byatewe n’urukozasoni rwa Cashgate.
"""My government has strengthened the financial system to make sure that Cashgate never occurs again in Malawi. We have resourced fairly well the law enforcement institutions, including the Anti-Corruption Bureau, so that they do a thorough independent job, prosecute all suspects, and recover the stolen resources where possible,"" said Mutharika."	Guverinoma yanjye yashimangiye gahunda y’imari kugira ngo Cashgate itazongera kubaho muri Malawi. Twakiriye neza inzego zishinzwe kubahiriza amategeko, harimo na Biro ishinzwe kurwanya ruswa, kugira ngo bakore akazi kigenga, bakurikirane abakekwaho icyaha bose, kandi kugarura umutungo wibwe aho bishoboka, Mutharika.
Mutharika also said his government is implementing newly-adopted fiscal reforms that seek to grow the countrys economy by 5.5 percent in 2014, up from an estimated 5.0 percent in 2013.	Mutharika yavuze kandi ko guverinoma ye ishyira mu bikorwa ivugurura ry’imari ryashyizweho hagamijwe kuzamura ubukungu bw’igihugu ku gipimo cya 5.5 ku ijana muri 2014, kikaba kivuye ku kigereranyo cya 5.0% muri 2013.
Malawi to Conduct Door-to-Door HIV Testing	Malawi gukora Ikizamini cya virusi itera sida ku muryango
Malawians have mixed reactions to government plans to introduce door-to door HIV testing early next year. Supporters say the step is urgently needed because 100 Malawians get infected each day, and an average of 138 die from AIDS daily. Minister of Health Jean Kalirani announced the plans during the recent commemoration of World AIDS Day in the northern district of Karonga.	Abanya Malawiya batanze ibitekerezo kuri gahunda za leta zo kwipimisha ku nzu n'inzu mu ntangiriro z'umwaka utaha. Abashyigikiye bavuga ko iyi ntambwe ikenewe byihutirwa kubera ko Abanya Malawi 100 bandura buri munsi, kandi impuzandengo ya 138 bapfa bazize sida buri munsi. Minisitiri w’ubuzima Jean Kalirani yatangaje gahunda mu gihe cyo kwibuka umunsi mpuzamahanga wahariwe kurwanya SIDA mu karere ka Karonga gaherereye mu majyaruguru.
"""We will go in the villages asking for blood samples to check whether that person is HIV positive or not. And those that will be found HIV positive will definitely be given the care they need. And those who are found negative will also be counseled so that they remain negative,"" said Kalirani."	Tuzajya mu midugudu dusaba amaraso kugira ngo tumenye niba uwo muntu afite virusi itera SIDA cyangwa niba atari bo. Kandi abazagaragara ko banduye virusi itera SIDA bazahabwa ubwitonzi bakeneye. Kandi abagaragaye ko ari babi na bo bazabigirwa inama. ko bakomeza kuba babi , Kalirani.
Kalirani said the campaign will start in mid-March and will aim to reach everyone in the country, including people who are far from health facilities that provide HIV testing and counseling services. She said the campaign is in line with the goal of ending HIV infection by 2030. Malawi's HIV infection rate is currently at 10 percent, a slight drop from three years ago.	Kalirani yavuze ko ubukangurambaga buzatangira hagati muri Werurwe kandi bugamije kugera kuri buri wese mu gihugu, harimo n'abantu bari kure y'ibigo nderabuzima bitanga serivisi zipimisha virusi itera SIDA. Yavuze ko ubukangurambaga bujyanye n'intego yo guhagarika ubwandu bwa virusi itera SIDA mu 2030. Muri iki gihe umubare w'ababana na virusi itera SIDA uri muri Malawi uri ku gipimo cya 10 ku ijana, ukaba wagabanutseho gato mu myaka itatu ishize.
The announcement has raised fears in some Malawians, such as Steven Jailosi, a primary school teacher in rural Blantyre, who feel the campaign will likely infringe upon peoples privacy.	Iri tangazo ryateje ubwoba bamwe mu Banya Malawi, nka Steven Jailosi, umwarimu w’ishuri ryibanze mu cyaro cya Blantyre, bumva ko ubukangurambaga bushobora guhungabanya ubuzima bwite bw’abaturage.
"""I think it is not okay because they will be invading our privacy. HIV testing is supposed to be private. No one is supposed to know that I went for an HIV testing unless I make a choice to tell them,"" said Jailosi."	"Jailosi ati: ""Ntekereza ko atari byiza kuko bazinjira mu buzima bwacu. Kwipimisha virusi itera sida bigomba kuba byihariye. Nta muntu ugomba kumenya ko nagiye kwipimisha virusi itera sida keretse mpisemo kubabwira""."
Ester Makonokaya, a secretary in Blantyre, said that although she has been tested already, she feels the door-to-door HIV testing will violate people's privacy.	Ester Makonokaya, umunyamabanga muri Blantyre, yavuze ko nubwo yamaze kwipimisha, yumva ko kwipimisha virusi itera sida ku nzu n'inzu bizahungabanya ubuzima bwite bw'abantu.
"""Government should instead take the mobile clinics to the villages where people will be able to access them on their own rather than taking testing in their homes, because that might mean that some of the people who are not supposed to know other peoples status will know because, you know, when someone has been tested you show some reactions,"" said Makonokaya."	Guverinoma igomba ahubwo kujyana amavuriro agendanwa mu midugudu aho abantu bazashobora kuyageraho bonyine aho kwipimisha mu ngo zabo, kuko ibyo bivuze ko bamwe mu bantu batagomba kumenya uko abandi baturage bazabimenya. kuberako, urabizi, iyo umuntu yapimwe uba ugaragaje reaction zimwe , Makonokaya.
"Macpherson Maulana, a journalist in Blantyre and a producer of radio programs on health, told VOA that government would do better to educate Malawians on the need for HIV testing so that people will go for tests on their own ""without being pushed."""	"Macpherson Maulana, umunyamakuru muri Blantyre akaba na progaramu ya radiyo ku buzima, yabwiye Ijwi rya Amerika ko guverinoma izakora ibishoboka byose kugira ngo yigishe Abanya Malawi ko bakeneye kwipimisha virusi itera SIDA kugira ngo abantu bajye kwipimisha bonyine ""badasunitswe."""
"""I fear it could end up into fights. You see it happened in Liberia recently where people who were coming to help people suspected to have contracted Ebola were even killed. So, civic education is the most important element for people to be encouraged to come out for testing voluntarily,"" said Maulana."	Ndatinya ko bishobora kurangira mu mirwano. Urabona ko byabereye muri Liberiya vuba aha aho abantu bari baje gufasha abantu bakekwaho kuba baranduye Ebola ndetse bakicwa. Rero, uburere mboneragihugu ni cyo kintu cy'ingenzi abantu bashishikarizwa kuza hanze yo kwipimisha ku bushake, Maulana.
However, HIV/AIDS counselor David Odali, whose NGO Umunthu Foundation runs HIV-related projects, insisted privacy will be protected.	Icyakora, umujyanama wa virusi itera SIDA, David Odali, umuryango utegamiye kuri Leta Umunthu Foundation ukora imishinga ijyanye na virusi itera SIDA, yashimangiye ko ubuzima bwite buzarindwa.
"""Confidentiality will be upheld. Lets consider the household setup. I think the first thing would be to provide group counseling to members of that family. [Of course] people can be tested while others are watching, but when it comes to disclosing the results, a counselor is supposed to disclose that results to each and every individual separately,"" said Odali."	Amabanga azubahirizwa. Reka dusuzume uko urugo rumeze. Ntekereza ko ikintu cya mbere cyaba ari ugutanga inama mu matsinda ku bagize uwo muryango. [Birumvikana ko] abantu bashobora kwipimisha mu gihe abandi bareba, ariko mu gihe cyo gutangaza ibisubizo. , umujyanama agomba guhishura ibisubizo kuri buri muntu ku giti cye , Odali.
Odali said it will be up to the person who has been tested to disclose his or her status.	Odali yavuze ko umuntu uzapimwa azagaragaza uko ahagaze.
In 2006, the charity Development Aid from People to People conducted door-to-door HIV testing in the district of Thyolo and Blantyre, reaching 400,000 people. The organization says it worked well.	Mu mwaka wa 2006, imfashanyo ishinzwe iterambere ry’abantu kuva ku bantu kugeza ku bantu bakoze isuzuma ku nzu n'inzu mu karere ka Thyolo na Blantyre, bagera ku 400.000. Uyu muryango uvuga ko wakoze neza.
Water Crisis Raises Fears of Waterborne Disease in Malawi	Ikibazo cy’amazi gitera ubwoba bwindwara ziterwa n’amazi muri Malawi
Malawians in the country's commercial capital, Blantyre, usually rely on tap water. But for the past five months, the taps have often run dry, forcing residents to draw water from unprotected sources like rivers and wells, while work is being done at the city main pumping station.The risk of contracting water-borne diseases is rising.	Abanya Malawi mu murwa mukuru w’ubucuruzi w’igihugu, Blantyre, bashingira ku mazi meza. Ariko mu mezi atanu ashize, robine yakunze gukama, bigatuma abaturage bavoma amazi mu masoko adakingiwe nk'inzuzi n'amariba, mu gihe imirimo ikorerwa kuri sitasiyo nkuru yo mu mujyi. Ibyago byo kwandura indwara ziterwa n'amazi biriyongera.
In Blantyre and surrounding areas, residents have spent five days without tap water.	Muri Blantyre no mu turere tuyikikije, abaturage bamaranye iminsi itanu nta mazi meza.
Women, who by Malawi tradition are responsible for household tasks, complain of the risks they face when fetching water from rivers far from residential areas.	Abagore, bakurikije imigenzo ya Malawi bashinzwe imirimo yo murugo, binubira ingaruka bahura nazo mugihe bavoma amazi mumigezi kure yabatuye.
"Rhoda Milanzi, a housewife and mother of three, tells VOA the journeys through bushy footpaths are risky. ""We wake up every day 2 a.m., sometimes 1 a.m., to go and collect water. There are so many risks. You see, sometimes we would meet witches, snakes on the way,"" she says, ""even hyenas have been chasing us."""	"Rhoda Milanzi, umugore wo murugo akaba na nyina wabana batatu, abwira IJWI ingendo zinyura mumihanda y'ibihuru ishobora guteza akaga. Agira ati: ""Turabyuka buri munsi saa mbiri za mu gitondo, rimwe na rimwe mu gitondo, kugira ngo tujye gukusanya amazi. Hariho ingaruka nyinshi. Urabona, rimwe na rimwe twahuraga n'abapfumu, inzoka mu nzira"", ndetse n'impyisi zagiye zidukurikirana. . """
Milanzi says to ease the burden of carrying water home for bathing, women prefer to bathe in the river. But she says they have been disturbed by youths who hide in the nearby bush.	Milanzi avuga ko koroshya umutwaro wo gutwara amazi murugo rwo kwiyuhagira, abagore bahitamo kwiyuhagira muruzi. Ariko avuga ko bahungabanijwe n’urubyiruko rwihishe mu gihuru kiri hafi.
"""These youths of today would come there and hide somewhere to see us naked. This has been a major embarrassment. In fact we complained to the chiefs about it."	Uru rubyiruko rwo muri iki gihe rwazaga hariya rwihisha kugira ngo rutubone twambaye ubusa. Ibi byabaye isoni zikomeye. Mubyukuri twaritotombeye abatware. Bahannye bamwe muri bo, ariko uzi ko rimwe na rimwe bazamuka ibiti kugira ngo barebe abagore bakuze nkatwe.
The water problem also has affected the delivery of health services.	Ikibazo cy’amazi nacyo cyagize ingaruka ku itangwa rya serivisi z'ubuzima.
Three weeks ago, authorities at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre confirmed that they had suspended surgical operations due to water scarcity.	Ibyumweru bitatu bishize, abayobozi mu bitaro bikuru by’umwamikazi Elizabeth i Blantyre bemeje ko bahagaritse ibikorwa byo kubaga kubera kubura amazi.
Health rights campaigners warn of the possible outbreak of waterborne diseases, especially in densely populated areas, if the situation is left unresolved.	Abaharanira uburenganzira bw’ubuzima baraburira ko hashobora kubaho indwara ziterwa n’amazi, cyane cyane mu turere dutuwe cyane, niba ikibazo kidakemutse.
Officials at the Blantyre Water Board attribute the problem largely to an ongoing European Union-funded project that seeks to install new pumping machines at Walkers Ferry, the main pumping station. Priscilla Mateyu, the spokesperson for the Blantyre Water Board, says the project is expected to increase water production capacity to 105,000 cubic meters per day from the current daily production of 78,000 cubic meters.	Abayobozi mu kigo cy’amazi cya Blantyre bavuga ko iki kibazo ahanini cyatewe n’umushinga uterwa inkunga n’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi ushaka gushyira imashini nshya zo kuvoma kuri Walkers Ferry, sitasiyo nkuru yo kuvoma. Priscilla Mateyu, umuvugizi w’ikigo cy’amazi cya Blantyre, avuga ko umushinga uteganijwe kongera ingufu z’amazi kugera kuri metero kibe 105.000 ku munsi uhereye ku musaruro wa buri munsi wa metero 78.000.
"""January is when the project is finishing. But for the new machines and everything else to start working properly, we have to wait until March [2015]. That's when we expect the levels would increase and also production capacity improving to least what we expect it to be,"" Mateyu said."	Mutarama ni bwo umushinga urangiye. Ariko kugira ngo imashini nshya n'ibindi byose bitangire gukora neza, tugomba gutegereza kugeza muri Werurwe [2015]. Nibwo twizeye ko urwego rwiyongera kandi n'ubushobozi bwo kongera umusaruro bugera ku byo dutegereje bigomba kuba, Mateyu ati.
The local consumer rights watchdog, the Consumers Association of Malawi, had been planning to hold vigils at the water board until the water supply was normalized, but the board asked protesters to hold off, promising to distribute water to residents through mobile water tanks. The consumer rights group has given the water board two weeks to fulfill its commitment before proceeding with the protests.	Ishyirahamwe ry’uburenganzira bw’umuguzi ryaho, Ishyirahamwe ry’abaguzi muri Malawi, ryateganyaga gukomeza kuba maso ku kibaho cy’amazi kugeza igihe amazi azaba asanzwe, ariko inama y'ubutegetsi yasabye abigaragambyaga guhagarika, basezeranya guha abaturage amazi binyuze mu bigega by’amazi.

Malawi President Under Fire for Giving Money to Journalists	Perezida wa Malawi uri mu muriro kubera guha amafaranga abanyamakuru
Malawi President Peter Mutharika is under fire for giving envelopes containing $125 to more than 80 media people at a dinner he hosted last month in Blantyre. The editor of the privately owned Times Television said reporters were told the envelopes contained the presidents plans for the media - which has been critical of the governments economic performance.	Perezida wa Malawi, Peter Mutharika, arashinjwa gutanga amabahasha arimo amadolari 125 ku banyamakuru barenga 80 mu birori yakiriye i Blantyre. Umuyobozi w'ikinyamakuru Times Televiziyo yigenga yavuze ko abanyamakuru babwiwe ko mu ibahasha irimo gahunda za ba perezida ku itangazamakuru - ryanenze imikorere ya guverinoma.
In his column published in Malawis Sunday Times newspaper, editor Grecian Tukula said he was not sure why the money was given to journalists at the state dinner.	Mu nkingi ye yasohotse mu kinyamakuru Malawis Sunday Times, umwanditsi Grecian Tukula yavuze ko atazi neza impamvu ayo mafaranga yahawe abanyamakuru mu ifunguro rya Leta.
"Tukula said he initially decided to return the money but reversed the decision to avoid ""creating a scene."""	"Tukula yavuze ko yabanje gufata icyemezo cyo gusubiza amafaranga ariko ahindura icyemezo cyo kwirinda ""gukora ibintu."""
But the editor for the Weekend Nation newspaper, George Kasakula, told VOA that he returned the money right away.	Ariko umwanditsi w'ikinyamakuru Weekend Nation, George Kasakula, yabwiye VOA ko yahise asubiza amafaranga.
"""I just felt it was not right for me to receive the money, so I returned it. My understanding is that if someone invites me to a workshop, its their duty to ensure that they feed me, they accommodate me and they transport me. But in this case, I didnt see why I should get that allowance because I didnt spend anything to go to Sanjika [Palace],"" said Kasakula."	Gusa numvaga bidakwiriye ko nakira ayo mafaranga, nuko ndayasubiza. Ndumva ko niba umuntu antumiye mu mahugurwa, inshingano zabo zo kureba ko bampa, baranyakira kandi barantwara. Ariko muri uru rubanza, sinigeze mbona impamvu nkwiye kubona ayo mafaranga kubera ko ntacyo nakoresheje ngo njya i Sanjika [Ingoro] , Kasakula.
The issue has attracted more public attention after privately owned Capital Radio aired a story questioning the meaning of the cash handouts from the president.	Iki kibazo cyashimishije abantu benshi nyuma y’uko abikorera ku giti cyabo Radio Radio yerekanaga inkuru ibaza icyo amafaranga yatanzwe na perezida.
"""As Capital FM we serve the interest of the public. This issue has been all over the social media, and even we as a media are implicated [we believe] it is paramount that we follow up and get to the bottom of the matter,"" said Steven Dakalira, the head of news and current affairs at Capital Radio."	"Nka Capital FM dukorera inyungu za rubanda. Iki kibazo cyabaye ku mbuga nkoranyambaga, ndetse natwe nk'itangazamakuru tubigiramo uruhare [twizera ko ari ngombwa ko dukurikirana kandi tukagera ku kibazo, ""ibi bikaba byavuzwe na Steven Dakalira, ukuriye amakuru n'ibikorwa muri iki gihe kuri Radiyo Nkuru."
In his column in the Nyasa Times, Malawi professor of law Danwood Mzikenge Chirwa said what President Mutharika did by giving money handouts to journalists at a news event was tantamount to bribery. He has called on Mutharika to resign or face impeachment proceedings.	Mu nkingi ye mu kinyamakuru Nyasa Times, umwarimu w’amategeko muri Malawi, Danwood Mzikenge Chirwa, yavuze ko ibyo Perezida Mutharika yakoze mu gutanga amafaranga ku banyamakuru mu birori by’amakuru byari bihwanye na ruswa. Yahamagariye Mutharika kwegura cyangwa gukurikiranwa mu nkiko.
"Local civil society groups said that ""by attempting to bribe the journalists"" Mutharika subjected his leadership style to disrepute."	"Imiryango itegamiye kuri leta yavuze ko ""mu gushaka guha ruswa abanyamakuru"" Mutharika yakoresheje uburyo bwe bwo kuyobora."
Meanwhile, some journalists are donating the money to charity.	Hagati aho, bamwe mu banyamakuru batanga amafaranga mu gufasha.
Brian Ligomeka, the Managing Editor for the Times Group, told Times Television that all four employees there have donated the money to an orphanage.	Umuyobozi mukuru w'ikinyamakuru Times Group, Brian Ligomeka, yatangarije Televiziyo ya Times ko abakozi bose uko ari bane batanze amafaranga mu kigo cy'imfubyi.
"""At first we decided to return the money to the president but we later thought it wise to buy assorted items like sugar, salt, notebooks and donate it to needy children,"" said Ligomeka."	"Ligomeka ati: ""Twabanje gufata icyemezo cyo gusubiza amafaranga perezida ariko nyuma twatekereje ko ari byiza kugura ibintu bitandukanye nk'isukari, umunyu, amakaye maze tukabiha abana batishoboye""."
"In his latest Sunday Times column, Raphael Tenthani, who also writes for BBC, apologized on behalf of other journalists ""for letting down the public that trust journalists unreservedly."""	"Mu kinyamakuru Sunday Times aheruka gusohora, Raphael Tenthani, nawe wandika kuri BBC, yasabye imbabazi mu izina ry'abandi banyamakuru ""kubera ko yaretse rubanda yizera abanyamakuru bidasubirwaho."""
Tenthani has since donated the money for charity work and said that although the journalists could have done better if they returned the money right away, doing so would have been perceived as disrespect to the head of state.	Kuva icyo gihe Tenthani yatanze amafaranga mu bikorwa by'urukundo avuga ko nubwo abanyamakuru bashoboraga gukora neza baramutse basubije amafaranga ako kanya, kubikora byari gufatwa nko gusuzugura umukuru w'igihugu.
Maclan Kanyangwa, who heads the Department of Journalism and Media Studies at the Polytechnic College of the University of Malawi, said a media code of ethics bars journalists from accepting payment on a story.	Maclan Kanyangwa uyobora ishami ry’itangazamakuru n’ubushakashatsi mu itangazamakuru muri kaminuza ya Polytechnic ya kaminuza ya Malawi, yavuze ko amategeko agenga imyitwarire ibuza abanyamakuru kwakira ubwishyu ku nkuru.
"""Obviously the meeting at the palace was the newsworthy event. There was a possibility that something was going to be published. And in the event that this payment would have influenced journalist decision [on news judgment], then that becomes a problem,"" said Kanyangwa."	"Ati: ""Biragaragara ko inama yabereye ibwami yari igikorwa cyo gutangaza amakuru. Byashobokaga ko hari ikintu kigiye gutangazwa. Kandi mu gihe aya mafaranga yari kugira uruhare mu cyemezo cy'abanyamakuru [ku rubanza rw'amakuru], noneho biba ikibazo."" Kanyangwa."
Kanyangwa said he feels many journalists failed to return the money immediately because they might have been out of their ethical senses when they got the money.	Kanyangwa yavuze ko yumva abanyamakuru benshi bananiwe gusubiza amafaranga ako kanya kuko bashobora kuba baravuye mu myitwarire yabo igihe babonye amafaranga.
Efforts to talk to Presidential Press Officer Fredrick Ndala were not successful. But some government authorities say the payment was not a bribe but meant for a fuel refund to those who attended the night event.	Imbaraga zo kuvugana n’umuyobozi ushinzwe itangazamakuru rya Perezida Fredrick Ndala ntizagenze neza. Ariko bamwe mu bayobozi ba leta bavuga ko kwishyura atari ruswa ahubwo ko byari bigamije gusubizwa lisansi abitabiriye ibirori bya nijoro.
Report: Manufacturing Could Free Poorest Nations From Poverty	Raporo: Inganda zishobora kuvana ibihugu bikennye mubukene
A new United Nations report urges the poorest countries in the world to shift from low- to high-productivity activities to improve their economies.	Raporo nshya y’umuryango w’abibumbye irasaba ibihugu bikennye cyane ku isi kuva mu bikorwa bito bikagera ku musaruro mwinshi kugira ngo ubukungu bwiyongere.
"In its annual Least Developed Countries Report, UNCTAD — the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development — says these countries must structurally transform their economies to free themselves from the ""poverty trap,"" which is stunting economic growth and development."	"Muri raporo y’ibihugu byateye imbere cyane cyane, UNCTAD - Inama y’umuryango w’abibumbye ishinzwe ubucuruzi n’iterambere - ivuga ko ibyo bihugu bigomba guhindura imiterere y’ubukungu kugira ngo bikure mu ""mutego w’ubukene,"" bidindiza iterambere ry’ubukungu n’iterambere."
"Of the 48 nations the U.N. considers ""Least Developed Countries"" (LDCs), only one, Laos, is on track to achieve all seven of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) by 2015."	"Mu bihugu 48 Umuryango w'abibumbye ufata ""Ibihugu byateye imbere cyane"" (LDCs), kimwe gusa, Laos, kiri mu nzira zo kugera ku ntego zirindwi z'ikinyagihumbi (MDG) muri 2015."
Only four African countries — Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda — are likely to meet a majority of these targets.	Ibihugu bine bya Afurika gusa - Etiyopiya, Malawi, u Rwanda na Uganda - birashoboka ko byujuje ibyinshi muri byo.
This assessment is particularly grim in light of the even greater challenges awaiting these countries in the coming years. The MDGs set a goal for nations to halve their poverty levels by 2015. The so-called Sustainable Development Goals, which carry on from where the MDGs leave off, call for eradication of poverty by 2030.	Iri suzuma rirakaze cyane bitewe n’ibibazo bikomeye bitegereje ibi bihugu mu myaka iri imbere. MDGs yihaye intego ibihugu kugabanya ubukene bw’ubukene bitarenze 2015. Icyiswe intego z’iterambere rirambye, kiva aho MDGs ziva, zirahamagarira guca ubukene mu 2030.
According to Taffere Tesfachew, an UNCTAD official who works with African nations, it would be nothing short of a miracle for the LDCs to pull this off.	Nk’uko byatangajwe na Taffere Tesfachew, umuyobozi wa UNCTAD ukorana n'ibihugu by'Afurika, nta kintu na kimwe cyaba ari igitangaza kuri LDCs kubikuramo.
In order for the least developed countries to achieve this miraculous performance, he says they will need to structurally change their economies.	Kugirango ibihugu bidateye imbere bigere kuri iyi mikorere yigitangaza, avuga ko bizakenera guhindura imiterere yubukungu.
He tells VOA this means shifting labor from activities with low productivity, such as small-scale agriculture and services to more dynamic activities with higher productivity, such as manufacturing and high-value services.	Abwira IJWI ibi bivuze guhindura imirimo mu bikorwa bifite umusaruro muke, nk'ubuhinzi buciriritse na serivisi ku bikorwa byinshi bifite umusaruro mwinshi, nko gukora na serivisi zifite agaciro kanini.
"""Countries that have moved up are the ones that are creating opportunities for those that are leaving agriculture to engage in things where they add value, where they get training and as it happens, manufacturing tends to have that sort of feature, that is why this call for manufacturing,"" he said.

Tesfachew says these high-productivity sectors tend to pay higher wages and create a demand for goods. This, he says, encourages investment.	Tesfachew avuga ko izo nzego zitanga umusaruro mwinshi zikunda kwishyura umushahara munini kandi bigatuma ibicuruzwa bikenerwa. Avuga ko ibi bitera inkunga ishoramari.
On the surface, it appears that the LDCs are not doing badly. UNCTAD economic data show growth in these poor countries between 2002 and 2008 exceeded the seven percent target set by the international community. And, even after the 2008 financial crisis, UNCTAD notes the LDCs grew faster than other developing countries, at an average of 5.7 percent per year.	Ku isura, bigaragara ko LDC idakora nabi.

But U.N. economists say the outlook for the least developed countries in the short and medium term remains uncertain. They say increasing peoples productivity is the best way to break the patter of human and economic underdevelopment that continues to entrap them in poverty.	Ariko abahanga mu bukungu bo muri Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika bavuga ko icyerekezo cy’ibihugu bitaratera imbere mu gihe gito kandi giciriritse bikomeje kutamenyekana.

UN: Most African Nations to Miss 2015 MDG Goals	Loni: Ibihugu byinshi bya Afrika ntibizagera  ku ntego za MDG 2015
Most African countries will not reach the Millennium Development Goals set for 2015 because of the gap between economic and human development. That is one of the conclusions in this years annual U.N. report on the Least Developed Countries, presented Thursday.	Ibihugu byinshi bya Afrika ntibizagera ku ntego z'ikinyagihumbi zashyizweho muri 2015 kubera itandukaniro riri hagati y’ubukungu n’iterambere ry’abantu. Uyu ni umwe mu myanzuro muri iyi myaka ya buri mwaka raporo y’umuryango w’abibumbye ku bihugu byateye imbere cyane, byatanzwe ku wa kane.
Junior Davis, U.N. economic affairs officer for Africa, said African countries have not been able to translate their economic growth into structural transformation.	Junior Davis, ushinzwe ibibazo by’ubukungu muri Amerika muri Afurika, yavuze ko ibihugu bya Afurika bitashoboye guhindura ubukungu bwabyo mu guhindura imiterere.
"""We think that is the case because these countries have not focused efficiently on building what we call their productive capacities,"" Davis said. ""These are the basic human and economic development capacities that are needed to promote sustainable economic development. And the MDG, as they were constructed, largely ignored the need to develop the productive capacities."""	"Davis yagize ati: ""Turatekereza ko aribyo kuko ibyo bihugu bitibanze cyane ku kubaka icyo twita ubushobozi bwabo bwo gutanga umusaruro"". ""Ubu ni bwo bushobozi bw’ibanze bw’iterambere ry’abantu n’ubukungu bukenewe kugira ngo iterambere ry’ubukungu rirambye. Kandi MDG, uko yubatswe, yirengagije ko ari ngombwa guteza imbere ubushobozi butanga umusaruro."""
Slow progress	Buhoro buhoro
African countries also are not on course to halve poverty by 2015, and their overall progress on reducing hunger is relatively slow. Poverty limits human development and undermines productivity. And economic development is needed to make gains in human development.	Ibihugu bya Afurika nabyo ntabwo biri mu nzira yo kugabanya ubukene bitarenze 2015, kandi iterambere ryabo muri rusange mu kugabanya inzara biratinda. Ubukene bugabanya iterambere ryabantu kandi bigabanya umusaruro. Kandi iterambere ryubukungu rirakenewe kugirango umuntu yunguke iterambere ryabantu.
Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi are the only African countries on track to reach the majority of the development goals. They are making progress because they heavily invested in areas that create sustainable development such as infrastructure, health and education.	Etiyopiya, u Rwanda, Uganda na Malawi nicyo gihugu cyonyine cya Afurika kiri mu nzira yo kugera ku ntego nyinshi z’iterambere. Barimo gutera imbere kuko bashora imari mubice bitera iterambere rirambye nkibikorwa remezo, ubuzima nuburezi.
The post-2015 development agenda for fragile countries where governance remains an issue — such as South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo — will still largely depend on support from the international community to achieve social and economic development, Davis said.	Davis yavuze ko gahunda y’iterambere ry’inyuma ya 2015 ku bihugu byoroshye aho imiyoborere ikomeje kuba ikibazo - nka Sudani y'Amajyepfo na Repubulika Iharanira Demokarasi ya Kongo - bizaterwa ahanini n’inkunga n’umuryango mpuzamahanga kugira ngo iterambere ry’imibereho n’ubukungu ryiyongere.
"Improvements in rural development, industrial productivity, agriculture and the services sectors in these countries will require ""ways in which we can have a pattern of growth which is not just sustainable but jobs-rich,"" Davis said. ""Because we see the growth in jobs and employment is central to any development strategy that aims to reduce poverty in a sustainable way."""	"Davis yagize ati: ""Gutezimbere mu cyaro, umusaruro w’inganda, ubuhinzi n’inzego za serivisi muri ibi bihugu bizakenera"" inzira dushobora kugira uburyo bwo kuzamuka butarambye gusa ahubwo bukungahaye ku mirimo. "" ""Kubera ko tubona iterambere ry'imirimo n'akazi ari ingenzi mu ngamba zose z'iterambere zigamije kugabanya ubukene mu buryo burambye."""
A country is placed on the Least Developed Countries list based on its per capita income, economic vulnerability, and human development indicators such as health and nutrition.	Igihugu gishyizwe ku rutonde rw’ibihugu byateye imbere cyane hashingiwe ku musaruro w’umuturage, ubukungu bwifashe nabi, hamwe n’ibipimo by’iterambere ry’abantu nk’ubuzima n’imirire.
Of the 48 least developed countries in the world, 34 are in Africa. Three countries have graduated from their least developed status: Botswana, Cape Verde and Samoa.	Mu bihugu 48 bidateye imbere ku isi, 34 biri muri Afurika. Ibihugu bigaragara ko byateye imbere cyane: Botswana, Cape Verde na Samoa.
Strike Paralyzes Malawi's Judicial Services	Strike Paralyzes ishinzwe Serivisi z'ubutabera za Malawi
A week-long strike by the support staff of Malawi's judiciary system has paralyzed the courts, causing overcrowding in police cells and the indefinite suspension of major cases - including government corruption trials. Court marshals, clerks and messengers are demanding the 30 percent salary increases promised by the government two years ago.	Hashize icyumweru cyose abakozi bunganira inzego z'ubutabera za Malawi cyahagaritse inkiko, bituma ubucucike bw’abapolisi bwiyongera ndetse n’ihagarikwa ry’agateganyo mu manza zikomeye - harimo n’imanza za ruswa. Abashinzwe inkiko, abanditsi n’intumwa barasaba kongererwa umushahara 30% byasezeranijwe na guverinoma mu myaka ibiri ishize.
Chanting and singing around the court premises has become a pastime activity for the striking court workers since the onset of a sit-in last week. Linley Hebert, a spokesperson for the striking workers, told VOA the strike is a result of the governments failure to honor a 2012 agreement.	kuririmba hirya no hino mu rukiko byahindutse igikorwa cyo kwidagadura ku bakozi bigaragambyaga kuva icyumweru cyatangira. Linley Hebert, umuvugizi w’abakozi bigaragambyaga, yabwiye Ijwi rya Amerika ko iyi myigaragambyo ari ukubera ko guverinoma itubahirije amasezerano ya 2012.
"""In October [this year], the government reviewed the salaries of the civil servants, but we were not included in that revision,"" Hebert said."	"Hebert yagize ati: ""Mu Kwakira [uyu mwaka], guverinoma yasuzumye imishahara y'abakozi ba Leta, ariko ntitwashyizwe muri iryo vugurura."""
"""Yet in 2012, we had an agreement that each time they are revising the salaries of the civil servants, [they will be increasing our salaries as well]."	Nyamara muri 2012, twagiranye amasezerano ko igihe cyose barimo kuvugurura imishahara y'abakozi ba Leta, [bazongera umushahara]. Rero, [nyuma yo kubahiriza ayo masezerano mu 2013], twatunguwe no kubona ko iki gihe dusigaye. Abayobozi ba leta bavuga ko kutongera umushahara w'abakozi bo mu bucamanza muri uyu mwaka ahanini biterwa n'ubukungu buke, nyuma yo guhagarika inkunga y'abaterankunga. kurwanya leta ya Malawi.
The freeze is a result of a government financial scandal in which more than $30 million was looted from government coffers. Ministry of Finance spokesperson Nations Msowoya told a local radio station it is hard for the government to meet the workers' demand.	Ihagarikwa ni igisubizo cy’amafaranga ya leta aho yasahuye miliyoni zisaga 30 z’amadolari mu isanduku ya leta. Umuvugizi wa Minisiteri y’Imari, Msowoya, yatangarije radiyo yaho ko bigoye guverinoma isaba abakozi.
"""It is difficult to promise what the treasury will do. But suffice to say that the prevailing economic circumstances and budgetary constraints will make a little bit difficult for the treasury to bow down to the demands,"" ""Msowoya said."	"Msowoya ati: ""Biragoye gusezeranya icyo ikigega kizakora. Ariko birahagije kuvuga ko ubukungu bwiganje ndetse n'imbogamizi z’ingengo y’imari bizagora gato ko ikigega cyunama ku byifuzo."""
"But according to Hebert, the strikers will not resume work until their demands are met. ""Since I was born [there has been] no time the government said it had some money."	"Ariko nk'uko Hebert abitangaza ngo ba rutahizamu ntibazongera imirimo kugeza igihe ibyo basabye bituzuye. ""Kuva navuka [nta gihe] guverinoma yavuze ko ifite amafaranga."
"It has its own means [of finding the money] and it will find the same means to give us the money,"" Hebert insisted. The ongoing strike is hampering progress of trials, as court operations remain suspended."	"Ifite uburyo bwayo [bwo gushaka amafaranga] kandi izabona uburyo bumwe bwo kuduha ayo mafaranga "", Hebert yashimangiye."
Several trials, including that of former justice minister Ralph Kasambara, who is answering charges in connection with the financial scandal, were indefinitely suspended last week.	Mu cyumweru gishize, imanza nyinshi, harimo n'uwahoze ari minisitiri w’ubutabera, Ralph Kasambara, usubiza ibirego bijyanye n’ikibazo cy’amafaranga, yahagaritswe burundu mu cyumweru gishize.
Police are complaining of congestion in jail cells, as no suspects are being taken to court.	Polisi yinubira ubwinshi bw’imfungwa za gereza, kubera ko nta bakekwa bajyanwa mu rukiko.
"Malawi police spokesperson Rhoda Manjolo told VOA the only option they have is ""giving police bail to those with minor offenses."" Human rights campaigners and legal experts say the strike is contributing to human rights violations."	"Umuvugizi wa polisi muri Malawi, Rhoda Manjolo, yatangarije Ijwi rya Amerika ko inzira imwe bafite ari ""guha ingwate abapolisi bafite ibyaha byoroheje."" Abaharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu n'inzobere mu by'amategeko bavuga ko iyi myigaragambyo igira uruhare mu ihohoterwa ry'uburenganzira bwa muntu."
"""There are those people who have to be taken to court within 48 hours,"" noted Lawyer George Kadzipatike who works in a private practice in the northern city of Mzuzu. ""We cannot make application for them to be granted bail."	"Umunyamategeko George Kadzipatike ukora mu mwiherero mu mujyi wa Mzuzu uherereye mu majyaruguru yagize ati: ""Hariho abo bantu bagomba kujyanwa mu rukiko mu masaha 48"". ""Ntidushobora gusaba ko bahabwa ingwate."
"There are those people who do not want to live with their partners, they would like the court to decree that they be divorced, we cannot file any petition through the courts."""	"Hariho abo bantu badashaka kubana na bagenzi babo, bifuza ko urukiko rwemeza ko batana, ntidushobora gutanga ikirego binyuze mu nkiko. """
Government authorities say closed door negotiations to resolve the matter continue in the capital, Lilongwe. But the striking workers told VOA whatever the case, they will accept nothing short of a 30 percent increase in their salaries.	Abayobozi ba leta bavuga ko imishyikirano ihagaze kugira ngo iki kibazo ikemuke mu murwa mukuru, Lilongwe. Ariko abakozi bigaragambyaga babwiye VOA uko byagenda kose, nta kintu na kimwe bazemera ko umushahara wabo wiyongera 30%.
A similar strike lasted three months in 2012 after the magistrates and judges joined the labor action.	Imyigaragambyo nk'iyi yamaze amezi atatu muri 2012 nyuma yuko abacamanza bitabiriye umurimo.
Famine in Southern Africa Worse Than Predicted - 2002-07-24	Inzara muri Afrika yepfo Ikibi Kurenza Ibyahanuwe - 2002-07-24
The United Nations World Food Program says the famine in southern Africa is even worse than predicted. WFP officials are warning that 13 million people in six countries: Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Mozambique are in danger of starvation if they do not get food aid.	Ishami ry'Umuryango w'Abibumbye ryita ku biribwa rivuga ko inzara muri Afurika y'Epfo ikabije kuruta uko byari byavuzwe. Abayobozi ba WFP baraburira ko abantu miliyoni 13 mu bihugu bitandatu: Malawi, Zambiya, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Swaziland na Mozambique bafite ibyago byo kwicwa n'inzara nibatabona ubufasha bw'ibiribwa.
"World Food Program officials say they need one million tons of food to alleviate hunger in southern Africa, but they are not confident they will get it. In an appeal to the international community at the beginning of July, WFP officials asked for more than $0.5 billion to buy food. So far they have received only 20 percent of that. WFP's director for the southern Africa region, Judith Lewis, says the situation is getting desperate. ""The window of opportunity to avert what could be a major humanitarian crisis is closing,"" she said. ""We need more assistance now. We need food on the high seas now, or we need cash to buy commodities that are still available in southern Africa, so we can avert this major, major crisis."""	"Abayobozi ba gahunda y’ibiribwa ku isi bavuga ko bakeneye toni miliyoni y’ibiribwa kugira ngo bagabanye inzara muri Afurika yepfo, ariko ntibizeye ko bazayibona. Mu cyifuzo cy’umuryango mpuzamahanga mu ntangiriro za Nyakanga, abayobozi ba WFP basabye amadolari arenga 0.5 yo kugura ibiryo. Kugeza ubu bakiriye 20 ku ijana gusa. Umuyobozi wa WFP mu karere ka Afurika y'Epfo, Judith Lewis, avuga ko ibintu bimeze nabi. Ati: ""Idirishya ry'amahirwe yo gukumira icyaba ikibazo gikomeye cy’ubutabazi kirarangiye"". ""Ubu dukeneye ubufasha bwinshi. Dukeneye ibiryo ku nyanja ndende ubu, cyangwa dukeneye amafaranga yo kugura ibicuruzwa bikiboneka muri Afurika y'Epfo, bityo dushobora gukumira iki kibazo gikomeye kandi gikomeye."""
Currently, the WFP is assisting six million of the most vulnerable people in the six most severely affected countries. About half of these people are in Zimbabwe. The agency says it is sure the number of people needing its help will rise.	Kugeza ubu, WFP ifasha miliyoni esheshatu z’abatishoboye kurusha abandi mu bihugu bitandatu byibasiwe cyane. Hafi ya kimwe cya kabiri cyaba bantu bari muri Zimbabwe. Ikigo kivuga ko cyizeye neza ko umubare w'abantu bakeneye ubufasha bwacyo uziyongera.
The World Health Organization notes southern Africa, in addition to having the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the world, also has the world's highest chronic malnutrition rates. It predicts about 300,000 people could die over the next six months from diseases related to malnutrition.	Ishami ry'Umuryango w'Abibumbye ryita ku Buzima rivuga ko Afurika y'Epfo, usibye kuba yanduye virusi itera SIDA ku isi, ifite kandi imirire mibi idakira ku isi. Ivuga ko abantu bagera ku 300.000 bashobora gupfa mu mezi atandatu ari imbere bazize indwara ziterwa n'imirire mibi.
"Ms. Lewis says the dying has already begun. ""We are seeing people moving from their villages,"" she said. ""If they know there is going to be a food distribution, they immediately go there. The problem is we do not even have enough food to feed the people who are on the rolls, let alone add food for other people in the areas. Is there a potential to become chaotic? Yes. """	"Madamu Lewis avuga ko gupfa byatangiye. Ati: ""Turimo kubona abantu bimuka mu midugudu yabo."" ""Niba bazi ko hazabaho kugabura ibiryo, bahita bajyayo. Ikibazo nuko tutagira n'ibiryo bihagije byo kugaburira abantu bari kuri lisiti, tutibagiwe no kongeramo ibiryo kubandi bantu bo muri utwo turere. hari amahirwe yo kuba akajagari? Yego."
WFP'S Judith Lewis says at this time of year the agency is usually planning how to get food supplies into the region before the rainy season hits in October. But she says since the WFP is already having difficulty meeting its present targets, it can't even begin to plan for future food deliveries.	WFP'S Judith Lewis avuga ko muri iki gihe cy'umwaka ubusanzwe iki kigo giteganya uburyo bwo kwinjiza ibiribwa mu karere mbere yuko ibihe by'imvura bitangira mu Kwakira. Ariko avuga ko kubera ko WFP isanzwe ifite ikibazo cyo kugera ku ntego zayo ubu, ntishobora no gutangira gutegura ibiribwa bizaza.

Child Labor in Malawi - 2002-02-28	Imirimo ikoreshwa abana muri Malawi - 2002-02-28
The organization, Eye of the Child, is expressing concern about what is says is a large number of children who are being forced to work due to poverty.	Uyu muryango, Ijisho ry'umwana, urimo kwerekana ko uhangayikishijwe n'ibivugwa ko ari umubare munini w'abana bahatirwa gukora kubera ubukene.
It says these children risk being abused.	Ivuga ko aba bana bashobora guhohoterwa.
Some under aged children work as mini – bus call boys in the busy business district of Limbe in the commercial capital, Blantyre. They are some of the many children who have been forced into employment because of poverty.	Bamwe bari munsi yabana bakuze bakora nka mini - bisi ihamagarira abahungu mukarere gafite ubucuruzi bwa Limbe mumurwa mukuru wubucuruzi, Blantyre. Ni bamwe mu bana benshi bahatiwe akazi kubera ubukene.
"Maxwell Matewere is the executive director of Eye of the Child. He says many of the children come from rural areas. He says, ""Currently we havent done a data analysis but the Ministry of Labor intends to do that as soon as possible with financial resources from the International Labor Organization."	"Maxwell Matewere ni umuyobozi mukuru w'ijisho ry'umwana. Avuga ko benshi mu bana baturuka mu cyaro. Agira ati: ""Kugeza ubu ntabwo twakoze isesengura ry'amakuru ariko Minisiteri y'umurimo irateganya kubikora vuba bishoboka hamwe n'amafaranga aturuka mu Muryango mpuzamahanga."
But basing on our own assessment and through our works, we feel child labor is a serious problem particularly in the rural areas and you can tell that from trafficking of children from rural areas to urban areas where most of the young people are working in peoples houses.	Ariko dushingiye ku isuzuma ryacu bwite kandi binyuze mu mirimo yacu, twumva imirimo mibi ikoreshwa abana ari ikibazo gikomeye cyane cyane mu cyaro kandi urashobora kubabwira ko kuva kugurisha abana kuva mucyaro kugera mu mijyi aho usanga urubyiruko rwinshi rukorera mumazu yabantu. .
""" Mr. Matewere says poor children often find work on large farm estates."	Bwana Matewere avuga ko abana bakennye bakunze kubona akazi mu mirima minini.
"He said, ""We have noticed that there are some indications that there are children who are working in tea estates and tobacco estates."	Ati: Twabonye ko hari ibimenyetso byerekana ko hari abana bakora mu cyayi ndetse n’itabi.
"There also are children who are working in brick making mostly their parents will facilitate for them to work in those kinds of employment. """	"Hariho kandi abana bakora mumatafari cyane cyane ababyeyi babo bazaborohereza gukora murubwo bwoko bwakazi. """
Mr. Matewere says the Eye of the Child has established that there are gross violations of children rights in the country. These include, rape, defilement and being overworked.	Bwana Matewere avuga ko Ijisho ry'umwana ryagaragaje ko mu gihugu hari ihohoterwa rikabije ry'uburenganzira bw'abana. Ibi birimo, gufata kungufu, guhumana no gukora cyane.
He says this violates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.	Avuga ko ibyo binyuranyije n’amasezerano y’umuryango w’abibumbye y’uburenganzira bw’umwana.
"""If you look at the Convention of the Rights of a Child,"" he said, ""you will see that it provides for the protection for children from any kind of exploitation from any kind of harmful activities or act which threatens their health, their development which is a threat to education."	"Ati: ""Iyo urebye Amasezerano y’uburenganzira bw’umwana, uzabona ko ateganya kurinda abana ibikorwa ibyo ari byo byose byangiza ibikorwa cyangwa ibikorwa bibangamira ubuzima bwabo, iterambere ryabo. bikaba bibangamiye uburezi."
"So children who are found working in tea estates, who are found in brick making, obvious, their rights as it is provided for in the Convention for the Rights of the Children as well as in the constitution are violated. """	"Abana rero usanga bakorera mu cyayi usanga mu kubumba amatafari, bigaragara, uburenganzira bwabo nk'uko biteganywa n’amasezerano y’uburenganzira bw’abana kimwe n’itegeko nshinga. """
The Eye of the Child executive director says his organization is looking at ways of protecting the rights of a child.	Umuyobozi mukuru w'ijisho ry'umwana avuga ko umuryango we urimo gushaka uburyo bwo kurengera uburenganzira bw'umwana.
"He says to achieve this, the group has started a number of programs. ""We have recently started a new program and what we are trying to do is to inform the general public on the best interests of the child and to inform them on the rights of a child."	"Avuga ko kubigeraho, itsinda ryatangiye gahunda nyinshi. ""Duherutse gutangiza gahunda nshya kandi icyo tugerageza gukora ni ukumenyesha abaturage muri rusange inyungu z'umwana no kubamenyesha uburenganzira bw'umwana."
"At the same we want also to build up the capacity of the children themselves so that may be they can be use their authentic voice out their concerns. """	"Mugihe kimwe, turashaka kandi kongera ubushobozi bwabana ubwabo kugirango bibe aribyo bashobora gukoresha ijwi ryabo ryukuri kubibazo byabo. """
According to the Ministry of Labor authorities, many children are forced to leave school and find work because parents cannot afford school fees.

Zimbabwe Official Defends Crackdown on Protests, Urges Patience with Economy	Umukozi wa Zimbabwe arengera guhashya imyigaragambyo, arasaba kwihangana mu bukungu
Zimbabwe's minister of foreign affairs and international trade on Monday defended crackdowns on anti-government demonstrations and urged patience in turning around the country's foundering economy.	Kuri uyu wa mbere, minisitiri w’ububanyi n’amahanga w’ubucuruzi n’ubucuruzi mpuzamahanga wa Zimbabwe, yamaganye ihohoterwa ry’imyigaragambyo irwanya guverinoma anasaba kwihangana mu guhindura ubukungu bw’igihugu.
"Though ""everybody's got the right to demonstrate,"" there have ""been a lot of insinuations and campaigns of violence,"" Sibusiso B. Moyo told VOA in an interview. Citing public safety, he endorsed a Zimbabwe court's ruling hours earlier to uphold a police ban on a protest organized by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) alliance."	"Mu kiganiro ""Sibusiso B. Moyo"" yabwiye VOA mu kiganiro na Sibusiso B. Moyo ati: ""N'ubwo"" abantu bose bafite uburenganzira bwo kwerekana, ""habaye"" insinations nyinshi n’ubukangurambaga bw’ihohoterwa. "" Avuga ku mutekano rusange, yemeje icyemezo cyafashwe n’urukiko rwa Zimbabwe mbere y’uko icyemezo cy’abapolisi kibuza imyigaragambyo yateguwe n’umuryango utavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi uharanira demokarasi (MDC)."
Alliance leaders are pressing President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party for a role in a transitional government. They had organized a demonstration Monday in Bulawayo, the country's second-largest city, but police authorities banned it hours before its intended start. Two other opposition demonstrations still are planned this week: for the central city of Gweru on Tuesday and the southeastern city of Masvingo on Wednesday.	Abayobozi b’ubumwe barimo guhatira Perezida Emmerson Mnangagwa n’ishyaka riri ku butegetsi rya ZANU-PF kugira uruhare muri guverinoma y’inzibacyuho. Ku wa mbere, bari barateguye imyigaragambyo i Bulawayo, umujyi wa kabiri mu gihugu, ariko abayobozi ba polisi barabuhagaritse amasaha make mbere yuko gitangira. Muri iki cyumweru harateganijwe indi myigaragambyo ibiri itavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi: ku mujyi wa Gweru rwagati ku wa kabiri n’umujyi wa Masvingo uherereye mu majyepfo y’iburasirazuba.
Police also had pre-emptively banned a demonstration in Harare last Friday, a decision upheld by a Zimbabwe court. Hundreds of MDC supporters ignored the ban, leading to clashes between civilians and police. Video and photographs showed police hitting and kicking some demonstrators among actions that drew complaints of excessive force from civil and human rights groups, including the United Nations human rights office.	Ku wa gatanu ushize, abapolisi bari barabujije mbere na mbere imyigaragambyo yabereye i Harare, icyemezo cyemejwe n'urukiko rwa Zimbabwe. Amajana y'abashyigikiye MDC birengagije iryo tegeko, bituma habaho imirwano hagati y'abasivili n'abapolisi. Amashusho n'amafoto byerekanaga abapolisi gukubita no gukubita bamwe mu bigaragambyaga mu bikorwa byagaragazaga ibirego by’ingufu zikabije z’imiryango iharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu n’uburenganzira bwa muntu, harimo n’ibiro by’umuryango w’abibumbye bishinzwe uburenganzira bwa muntu.
Police, not demonstrators, showed up in force on Bulawayo streets Monday, with foot patrols wielding shields, batons and, in some cases, pistols. The Associated Press reported police trucks and water cannons positioned in the downtown area.	Ku wa mbere, abapolisi, ntabwo ari abigaragambyaga, berekanye imbaraga mu mihanda ya Bulawayo, bafite amarondo y'ibirenge akoresheje ingabo, inkoni ndetse rimwe na rimwe, pistolet. Ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abanyamerika Associated Press byatangaje ko amakamyo ya polisi hamwe n’ibisasu by’amazi biri mu mujyi rwagati.
A young man in Bulawayo, identifying himself only as James, told VOA that negotiations between the government and opposition leaders were even more important than demonstrations.	Umusore wo muri Bulawayo, wiyita James gusa, yabwiye Ijwi rya Amerika ko imishyikirano hagati ya guverinoma n’abayobozi batavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi ari ngombwa kuruta imyigaragambyo.
"""Honestly, to demonstrate, we can end up being hurt by being beaten, being chased around. There's really nothing that we see coming out of it,"" James said. ""But these men should sit down and see what they can do for us, especially us, the youth. … We have been affected a lot, and we are getting old just running."""	"James yagize ati: ""Mvugishije ukuri, kwerekana, dushobora kurangiza kubabazwa no gukubitwa, kwirukanwa hirya no hino. Mubyukuri ntakintu tubona kivamo."" ""Ariko aba bagabo bagomba kwicara bakareba icyo badukorera, cyane cyane twe, urubyiruko.… Twagize ingaruka nyinshi, kandi turasaza twiruka."""
"Moyo, the foreign minister, told VOA the administration is ""undertaking economic reforms [that] are fundamental and they are key to ensuring that even the youth would finally have jobs created for them, so that we can create an environment where investors and the capital will find it easy to come into this country, where jobs will be created, and the youth will be part and parcel of economic activity."""	"Minisitiri w’ububanyi n’amahanga w’ububanyi n’amahanga, Moyo, yabwiye VOA ko ubuyobozi ""bukora ivugurura ry’ubukungu [ko] ari ngombwa kandi ko ari urufunguzo rwo kwemeza ko n’urubyiruko amaherezo rwabashakira imirimo, kugira ngo dushobore gushyiraho ibidukikije aho abashoramari n’umurwa mukuru bizoroha kwinjira muri iki gihugu, ahazabera imirimo, kandi urubyiruko ruzagira uruhare mu bikorwa by'ubukungu. """
"Moyo said Zimbabwe is midway into a two-year ""transition stabilization program"" to revive the country's devastated economy: ""We have got one year to go and we are saying we should by then be out of the doldrums."""	"Moyo yavuze ko Zimbabwe iri hagati y’imyaka ibiri ""gahunda yo guhagarika inzibacyuho"" kugira ngo ubukungu bwifashe nabi mu gihugu: ""Dufite umwaka umwe kandi tuvuga ko icyo gihe tugomba kuva mu gihirahiro."""

Many struggle to buy basics such as food and medicine. With the poor economy and crops devastated by drought and a spring cyclone, the UN World Food Program anticipates that 5.5 million people will need emergency food aid by next April.

African civil society campaigners attending a conference in Tanzania were questioned and warned over the weekend, in what human rights activists say is part of a continuing clampdown on free speech in the East African nation.	Mu mpera z'icyumweru gishize, abakangurambaga ba sosiyete sivile nyafurika bitabiriye inama yabereye muri Tanzaniya barabajijwe kandi baraburirwa, mu byo abaharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu bavuga ko biri mu rwego rwo gukomeza gukumira ijambo mu gihugu cya Afurika y'Iburasirazuba.
Details are still emerging over what exactly happened to at least 40 civil society workers who ran afoul of security officials at this year's summit of the Southern African Development Community in Dar es Salaam.	Haracyagaragara ibisobanuro birambuye ku bakozi nibura 40 ba sosiyete sivile bayoboye abashinzwe umutekano mu nama y'uyu mwaka y'umuryango w'iterambere rya Afurika y'epfo i Dar es Saalam.
But rights experts said Monday that the episode is another worrying sign of heightened paranoia and harassment from the government.	Ariko impuguke mu bijyanye n'uburenganzira bwa muntu zavuze ko ku wa mbere iki gice ari ikindi kimenyetso gihangayikishije Paranoia ikabije ndetse no gutotezwa na guverinoma.
Catherine Eden, a lawyer for the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition, says the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding. South African delegates to the 15-nation conference, she said, wanted to hold a short commemoration of the seventh anniversary of South Africa's deadly Marikana mine massacre on Aug. 16. 	Catherine Eden, umunyamategeko mu ihuriro ry'abaharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu muri Tanzaniya, avuga ko ibyabaye byaturutse ku kutumvikana. Yavuze ko intumwa za Afurika y'Epfo mu nama y'ibihugu 15, yashakaga gukora mu gihe gito cyo kwibuka ku nshuro ya karindwi ubwicanyi bwibasiye ikirombe cya Marikana muri Afurika y'Epfo ku ya 16 Kanama.
So delegates at a side event sang the South African anthem, held a moment of silence and availed on their government to better protect its people. 	Intumwa rero mu birori byo kuririmba zaririmbye indirimbo yubahiriza Afurika y'Epfo, bacecekesha akanya kandi basaba guverinoma yabo kurinda abaturage bayo neza.
"""They wrote some messages on the flip charts, of which the little content that was captured in the flip charts read, 'Stop killing our people."""	"Ati:"" Banditse ubutumwa bumwe ku mbonerahamwe ya flip, muri yo ibintu bike byafashwe ku mbonerahamwe ya flip byanditseho ngo: ""Reka kwica abantu bacu""."
It's not clear if anyone was actually arrested. Other rights groups say that some foreign campaigners were arrested, but not interrogated.	Ntibiramenyekana niba koko hari umuntu wafashwe. Indi miryango iharanira uburenganzira bw'ikiremwamuntu ivuga ko bamwe mu bakangurambaga b'abanyamahanga batawe muri yombi, ariko ntibabazwe.
Afraid, insecure'	Ubwoba , umutekano muke
Eden says she was summoned by authorities as she went to the police station Friday night to meet with a local coordinator and then was let go with a warning. Police later went to delegates' hotel rooms looking for materials that they thought were a security threat. They found nothing, she said.	Eden avuga ko yahamagawe n'abayobozi ubwo yajyaga kuri polisi ku wa gatanu nijoro kugira ngo abonane n'umuhuzabikorwa waho hanyuma arekurwa aburiwe. Nyuma abapolisi bagiye mu byumba bya hoteri by'intumwa bashaka ibikoresho bibwiraga ko bibangamiye umutekano. yavuze ko nta cyo babonye.
Janet Zhou, director of the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development, was one of the campaigners questioned by security forces at her hotel.	Janet Zhou, umuyobozi w'umuryango uhuriweho n'inguzanyo n'iterambere rya Zimbabwe, yari umwe mu bakangurambaga babajijwe n'inzego zishinzwe umutekano muri hoteri ye.
"""I was afraid, I was insecure, I was traumatized to say the least,"" she told VOA."	"Yatangarije VOA ati: "" Natinyaga ko nta mutekano mfite, nari nahahamutse, mvuga make."""
She said police then told her — and her 40-person delegation — to remain in their hotel all day Saturday. She asked them if they were under arrest, to which they did not reply.	Yavuze ko abapolisi bamubwiye  - hamwe n'intumwa z'abantu 40 - kuguma muri hoteri yabo umunsi wose ku wa Gatandatu. Yababajije niba bafashwe, ariko ntibasubiza.
Perfectly valid'	Byemewe rwose '
Oryem Nyeko, a Kampala-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, noted that Tanzanian police didn't do anything technically illegal. But, he said, that doesn't make it right, either.	Oryem Nyeko, umushakashatsi ukomoka mu mujyi wa Kampala muri Human trend Watch, yavuze ko abapolisi ba Tanzaniya ntacyo bakoze mu buryo bwa tekiniki. Ariko, yavuze ko ibyo bidakora neza.
"""I think it's a perfectly valid thing for police to do,"" he said. ""However, the challenge with that is that it speaks to a wider problem in Tanzania as far as a closing civic space and the opportunities that people in civic society have to freely express themselves. This is part of a wider pattern of civic repression in the country."""	"Ati: ""Ntekereza ko ari ikintu cyemewe rwose n'abapolisi gukora"". ""Icyakora, imbogamizi kuri ibyo ni uko ivuga ku kibazo kinini muri Tanzaniya kugeza aho abaturage bafunga ndetse n'amahirwe abantu bo muri sosiyete sivile bagomba kwigaragaza mu bwisanzure. Ibi ni bimwe mu buryo bwagutse bwo gukandamiza abaturage muri igihugu. """
"International groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists have also warned of increased repression. Ahead of the SADC summit, the watchdog group noted its concerns about a ""deeply troubling erosion of press freedom,"" and of ""attacks on individual journalists, media suspensions, internet shutdowns, and restrictive legislation."""	"Amatsinda mpuzamahanga nka komite ishinzwe kurengera abanyamakuru nayo yihanangirije ko gukandamizwa kwiyongera.

"""
The CPJ made special mention of Tanzanian journalists Azory Gwanda, who has been missing since 2017, and Erick Kabendera, who was arrested last month and charged with economic crimes, which the organization says is in retaliation for his critical journalism.	CPJ yavuze ku buryo budasanzwe abanyamakuru bo muri Tanzaniya Azory Gwanda waburiwe irengero kuva mu 2017, na Erick Kabendera watawe muri yombi mu kwezi gushize akurikiranyweho ibyaha by'ubukungu, uyu muryango uvuga ko ari ukwihorera kubera itangazamakuru rye rikomeye.
Kabendera remains behind bars. On Monday, Eden, his lawyer, said the court decided to adjourn to give prosecutors more time to investigate. That will keep him in jail for more than a week longer, until Aug. 30.	Kabendera ysshubijwe inyuma. Ku wa mbere, Eden, umwunganira, yavuze ko urukiko rwafashe icyemezo cyo gusubika kugira ngo abashinjacyaha babone igihe cyo gukora iperereza. Ibyo bizakomeza kumara igihe kirenze icyumweru, kugeza ku ya 30 Kanama.
Worrying trend'	Inzira yo guhangayika '
Anna Henga, director of the Legal and Human Rights Center, said police actions only further a worrying trend in Tanzania under President John Magafuli, whom critics say is becoming increasingly authoritarian.	Umuyobozi w'ikigo gishinzwe uburenganzira bwa muntu Anna Henga, yavuze ko ibikorwa bya polisi bikomeza gusa impungenge muri Tanzaniya iyobowe na Perezida John Magafuli, abanenga bavuga ko bigenda byigenga.
"""This means the continuation of a limited civic space. Because this has happened since 2016. There are a lot of issues, there is a negative development toward limited civic space.

Few Demonstrators Turn Up for Zimbabwe Protest in Bulawayo	Abigaragambyaga ni bake bitabira imyigaragambyo ya Zimbabwe i Bulawayo
Few people have turned up for an opposition protest in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, on Monday as armed police maintained heavy presence on the streets and at a courthouse where the opposition is pressing to be allowed to hold the demonstration.	Ku wa mbere, abantu bake bitabiriye imyigaragambyo y’abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi i Bulawayo, umujyi wa kabiri wa Zimbabwe, mu gihe abapolisi bitwaje intwaro bakomeje kuba benshi mu mihanda no mu rukiko aho abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi basaba ko bemererwa gukora iyo myigaragambyo.
Business in Bulawayo's usually bustling downtown was subdued with the most traffic from police trucks, water cannons and dozens of police officers patrolling on foot.	Ubucuruzi mu mujyi wa Bulawayo ubusanzwe bwuzuyemo umujyi rwagabanijwe n’imodoka nyinshi ziva mu gikamyo cya polisi, ibisasu by’amazi hamwe n’abapolisi benshi bakora irondo n'amaguru.
The opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, had called the protest as part of a planned series of demonstrations to push President Emmerson Mnangagwa to agree to a transitional government amid a rapidly deteriorating economy and rising political tensions.	Ishyaka ritavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi, Umuryango uharanira demokarasi riharanira demokarasi, ryari ryise imyigaragambyo mu rwego rwo gutegura imyigaragambyo yo guhatira perezida Emmerson Mnangagwa kwemeranya na guverinoma y’inzibacyuho mu gihe ubukungu bwifashe nabi ndetse n’ubushyamirane bukabije bwa politiki.
But the police banned the protest in the southern city, citing security concerns. A Bulawayo magistrate is hearing the opposition party's challenge to the ban.	Ariko abapolisi babujije imyigaragambyo mu mujyi wo mu majyepfo, kubera impungenge z'umutekano. Umucamanza wa Bulawayo arimo kumva ikibazo cy’ishyaka ritavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi.
The protest was planned as a follow up to demonstrations held in the capital, Harare, on Friday when several hundred demonstrators marched in defiance of a police ban that was upheld by the High Court. Police used tear gas and beatings with batons to quell the Harare protest.

UN Condemns Government Crackdown on Peaceful Protests in Zimbabwe	Umuryango w'abibumbye wamaganye igitero cya guverinoma ku myigaragambyo y'amahoro muri Zimbabwe
The U.N. human rights office is condemning a crackdown Friday in Zimbabwe by riot police on peaceful protesters in the capital, Harare. The agency is calling for an investigation into excessive use of force by security forces.	Ibiro bishinzwe uburenganzira bwa muntu muri Amerika biramagana igitero cyo ku wa gatanu muri Zimbabwe n’abapolisi bigaragambyaga ku bigaragambyaga mu mahoro mu murwa mukuru, Harare. Ikigo kirasaba ko hakorwa iperereza ku mikoreshereze ikabije y’inzego z’umutekano.
U.N. Human Rights spokesman Rupert Colville says there are better ways to deal with the populations legitimate grievances on the economic situation in the country than by cracking down on peaceful protestors.	Umuvugizi w’umuryango w’abibumbye uharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu, Rupert Colville, avuga ko hari inzira nziza zo guhangana n’abaturage bafite ibibazo byemewe ku bijyanye n’ubukungu bw’igihugu kuruta guhashya abigaragambyaga mu mahoro.
"""We are deeply concerned by the socio-economic crisis that continues to unfold in Zimbabwe. While acknowledging efforts made by the government, the international community and the U.N. in Zimbabwe to mitigate the effects of the crisis and reform process, the dire economic situation is now impacting negatively on the realization of economic and social rights of millions of Zimbabweans,"" Colville said."	Duhangayikishijwe cyane n'ikibazo cy'imibereho n'ubukungu gikomeje kugaragara muri Zimbabwe. Mu gihe dushimira imbaraga guverinoma yashyizeho, umuryango mpuzamahanga ndetse na Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika muri Zimbabwe mu rwego rwo kugabanya ingaruka z'ikibazo ndetse n'ivugurura, ubukungu bwifashe nabi. ubu bigira ingaruka mbi ku ishyirwa mu bikorwa ry'uburenganzira bw'ubukungu n'imibereho myiza y'abaturage ba miliyoni Zimbabwe , Colville.
Zimbabwes citizens are struggling with hyperinflation, which has sent prices soaring for essential commodities such as fuel, food, transportation and health care. Compounding the problems is the ongoing impact of cyclone Idai that hit Zimbabwe in March and a severe drought.	Abaturage ba Zimbabwes barwana na hyperinflation, yohereje ibiciro kuzamuka kubicuruzwa nkenerwa nka lisansi, ibiryo, ubwikorezi nubuvuzi. Kwiyongera ku bibazo ni ingaruka zikomeje kwibasirwa na serwakira Idai yibasiye Zimbabwe muri Werurwe n’amapfa akomeye.
The United Nations says one third of Zimbabwes population of 16 million people is in need of humanitarian aid.	Umuryango w'abibumbye uvuga ko kimwe cya gatatu cy'abaturage ba Zimbabwes batuye miliyoni 16 bakeneye ubufasha bw'ikiremwamuntu.
The fallout in terms of casualties and possible arrests from Fridays protests is not yet clear. But Colville tells VOA his office has received disturbing reports of human rights violations over the past few months.	Ikibazo cyo guhitanwa n’abahitanwa n’ifatwa ry’imyigaragambyo yo ku wa gatanu ntikiramenyekana. Ariko Colville abwira IJWI ibiro bye byakiriye raporo zibangamira ihohoterwa ry'uburenganzira bwa muntu mu mezi ashize.
"""There are, as I said, reports coming through right now of very recent abductions, beatings and so on of activists or human rights defenders. We have not had a chance to verify those and look in detail apart from the two that occurred a few days ago,"" Colville said. ""So, it is clearly a very tense situation."""	"Hariho nk'uko nabivuze, hari amakuru avugwa muri iki gihe ku ishimutwa rya vuba aha, gukubitwa n'ibindi nk'abarwanashyaka cyangwa abaharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu. Ntabwo twagize amahirwe yo kugenzura ibyo no kureba mu buryo burambuye usibye bibiri byabaye bike. hashize iminsi, Colville ati. ""Rero, biragaragara ko ari ibintu bitoroshye."""
Colville says state authorities have a duty to ensure peoples rights to freedom of expression and to protect the right to peaceful assembly.	Colville avuga ko abayobozi ba Leta bafite inshingano zo guharanira uburenganzira bw'abaturage bwo gutanga ibitekerezo no kurengera uburenganzira bwo guterana mu mahoro.
The U.N. human rights office is urging the government to engage in a national dialogue to ensure that civil society in all its guises can carry out its activities without fear of intimidation or reprisals for its work.	Ibiro by’uburenganzira bwa muntu by’umuryango w’abibumbye birasaba guverinoma kugirana ibiganiro by’igihugu kugira ngo sosiyete sivile mu buryo bwayo bwose ishobore gukora ibikorwa byayo nta gutinya iterabwoba cyangwa guhanwa kubera ibikorwa byayo.
Despite Oil and Gas Reserves, Africa Feels Pressure of Rising Energy Costs	Nubwo ibigega bya peteroli na gaze, Afurika irumva igitutu cyizamuka ryibiciro byingufu
Africans are feeling the pinch caused by soaring global energy prices, say analysts, even in countries like Nigeria and Angola that are major exporters of crude oil.	Abasesenguzi bavuga ko Abanyafurika bumva buke biterwa no kuzamuka kw'ibiciro by'ingufu ku isi, ndetse no mu bihugu nka Nijeriya na Angola byohereza peteroli nyinshi.
While that handful of oil producers is seeing an increase in revenue – especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24 – much of the continent lacks refining capability, forcing countries to pay high prices to import gasoline and other petroleum products from Asia and Europe.	Mu gihe ibyo bicuruzwa bikomoka kuri peteroli bigenda byiyongera - cyane cyane ko Uburusiya bwateye muri Ukraine ku ya 24 Gashyantare - igice kinini cy’umugabane kikaba kidafite ubushobozi bwo gutunganya, bigatuma ibihugu byishyura ibicuruzwa biva mu mahanga biva muri peteroli n’ibindi bicuruzwa biva muri Aziya no mu Burayi.
The continent is further affected by increasing costs for natural gas, a key component of nitrogen-based fertilizers used in food production.	Umugabane wongeye kwibasirwa no kongera ibiciro bya gaze naturel, igice cyingenzi cyamafumbire ashingiye kuri azote akoreshwa mugutanga ibiribwa.
With salaries largely stagnant, more than two-thirds of Africans feel pressured by the rising prices, said Franklin Cudjoe, founding president of the Ghana-based Imani Center for Policy and Education.	Kubera ko umushahara ahanini uhagaze, abarenga bibiri bya gatatu by'Abanyafurika bumva bahangayikishijwe n'izamuka ry'ibiciro nk'uko byatangajwe na Franklin Cudjoe, washinze ikigo cya Imani gishinzwe politiki n'uburezi muri Gana.
"""The continent is affected simply because we depend largely on global oil suppliers, since not many African countries have [their own] oil products,"" Cudjoe told VOA."	"Cudjoe yatangarije Ijwi rya Amerika ati: ""Umugabane ugira ingaruka gusa kubera ko ahanini dushingiye ku batanga peteroli ku isi, kubera ko mu bihugu byinshi bya Afurika bidafite ibikomoka kuri peteroli."""
Prices spiked on the global oil market after the invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of international sanctions against Russia, one of the worlds leading exporters of crude. The price briefly climbed to over $120 per barrel this month before settling down to $103 per barrel on Friday.	Ibiciro byazamutse ku isoko rya peteroli ku isi nyuma y’igitero cya Ukraine byateje ibihano mpuzamahanga ku Burusiya, kimwe mu bihugu biza kohereza ibicuruzwa hanze mu mahanga. Muri uku kwezi igiciro cyazamutse kigera ku madolari arenga 120 kuri buri barrale mbere yo kugabanuka kugeza ku madolari 103 kuri buri wa gatanu.
The surge in energy prices is helping to fuel inflation across Africa. In Ghana, for example, overall consumer price inflation was pegged at 15.7% year-on-year in February compared with 13.9% in January, the countrys Statistical Service said last week.	Kuzamuka kw'ibiciro by'ingufu bifasha kuzamura ifaranga muri Afurika. Urugero, muri Gana, muri rusange igiciro cy’ibiciro by’umuguzi cyashyizwe ku gipimo cya 15.7% umwaka ushize ugereranije na 13.9% muri Mutarama, nk'uko byatangajwe n’ikigo cy’ibarurishamibare mu gihugu mu cyumweru gishize.
In Zimbabwe, prices are climbing sharply – even overnight. At a TM supermarket in the capital of Harare, a crate of 30 eggs cost the $6.70 on Tuesday and about $7.81 on Wednesday. The price of a loaf of bread went from $1.49 to $1.84; for a kilo of beef, the price jumped from $3.35 to $5.22.	Muri Zimbabwe, ibiciro bizamuka cyane - ndetse nijoro. Ku wa kabiri, muri supermarket ya TM mu murwa mukuru wa Harare, isanduku y’amagi 30 yaguze amadolari 6.70 ku wa kabiri n’amadorari 7.81 ku wa gatatu. Igiciro cy'umugati cyavuye kuri $ 1.49 kigera ku $ 1.84; ku kilo cy'inka, igiciro cyavuye ku $ 3.35 kigera ku $ 5.22.
Gasoline costs climbed, too. In Harare, the per-liter price climbed from $1.41 to $1.69 from Tuesday to Wednesday.	Ibiciro bya lisansi byarazamutse, nabyo. I Harare, igiciro cya litiro cyazamutse kiva ku $ 1.41 kigera ku $ 1.69 kuva ku wa kabiri kugeza ku wa gatatu.
The surge in food prices was the biggest driver behind consumer inflation in Egypt, it rose by 8.8% in February – the sharpest increase in nearly three years, according to the state statistics agency, CAPMAS.	Izamuka ry’ibiciro by’ibiribwa niryo ryagize uruhare runini mu guta agaciro kw’abaguzi muri Egiputa, ryazamutseho 8.8% muri Gashyantare - kwiyongera gukabije mu myaka hafi itatu, nkuko bitangazwa n’ikigo cya Leta gishinzwe ibarurishamibare, CAPMAS.
Cudjoe said it was crucial for governments and regional bodies such as the African Union to build defenses to cushion consumers in times of economic uncertainty.	Cudjoe yavuze ko ari ngombwa ko guverinoma n’inzego z’akarere nk’Umuryango w’ubumwe bw’Afurika byubaka uburyo bwo guhashya abaguzi mu gihe ubukungu bwifashe nabi.
"""Even if it means building defenses in terms of the provision of food,"" said Cudjoe, adding, ""I could imagine Nigeria, if it had had its way, it could be selling foodstuff to most countries at reduced rates by now."""	"Cudjoe yagize ati: ""Nubwo byaba bisobanura kubaka ibirindiro mu bijyanye no gutanga ibiribwa"", yongeyeho ati: ""Nashoboraga gutekereza Nigeriya, iyaba ifite inzira, yashoboraga kugurisha ibiribwa mu bihugu byinshi ku giciro gito kugeza ubu."""
"""There must be that urgency of building for themselves defenses, funds that would make us sustain ourselves -- at least to prevent us from being completely annihilated by these uncertainties in the world."""	Hagomba kubaho ubwihutirwa bwo kwirwanaho, amafaranga yatuma dukomeza kwibeshaho - byibuze bikatubuza kurimburwa burundu n'ibi bidashidikanywaho ku isi.
"Chibamba Kanyama, an economist in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, said suspending fuel taxes would be ""the most ideal thing to do now under the circumstances"" to cushion consumers and industries."	"Chibamba Kanyama, impuguke mu by'ubukungu mu murwa mukuru wa Zambiya wa Lusaka, yavuze ko guhagarika imisoro ya peteroli ari ""ikintu cyiza cyane gukora ubu mu bihe"" kugira ngo abakoresha inganda n’inganda."
"""African governments must find a way of responding,"" he said. 'It is a choice of whether to reduce taxes to lower the prices or to maintain the price levels and use the revenues to subsidize the most vulnerable in society."""	"Ati: ""Guverinoma za Afurika zigomba gushaka uburyo bwo gusubiza."" 'Ni uguhitamo kugabanya imisoro kugira ngo ibiciro bigabanuke cyangwa kugumana urwego rw'ibiciro no gukoresha amafaranga yinjira mu gutera inkunga abatishoboye muri sosiyete. """
But Kanyama also suggested that the geopolitical crisis involving Russia and Ukraine – both big grain exporters to Africa – may create opportunities for African producers.	Ariko Kanyama yavuze kandi ko ikibazo cya geopolitiki kirimo Uburusiya na Ukraine - byombi byohereza ibicuruzwa muri Afurika - bishobora guha amahirwe abahinzi bo muri Afurika.
"""Supply countries like South Africa, with robust and highly mechanized systems, may find a window of exporting [commodities] like wheat and other products to fill the gaps left by Russia and Ukraine,"" Kanyama said."	"Kanyama ati: ""Gutanga ibihugu nka Afurika y'Epfo, hamwe na sisitemu zikomeye kandi zikoresha imashini zikoresha imashini nyinshi, birashobora kubona idirishya ryo kohereza ibicuruzwa mu mahanga nk'ingano n'ibindi bicuruzwa kugira ngo icyuho cyasizwe n'Uburusiya na Ukraine."""
Kanyama also said support by the international community – for instance, in the form of debt relief for some African nations – is welcome.	Kanyama yavuze kandi ko inkunga n’umuryango mpuzamahanga - urugero, mu rwego rwo kugabanya imyenda ku bihugu bimwe na bimwe bya Afurika - byemewe.
"He noted that the Group of 20 – which encompasses seven industrialized nations, some countries with strong or fast-growing economies, and the European Union – ""is trying to offer some debt relief."""	"Yagaragaje ko Itsinda rya 20 - rikubiyemo ibihugu birindwi byateye imbere mu nganda, ibihugu bimwe na bimwe bifite ubukungu bukomeye cyangwa byihuta cyane, ndetse n’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi - ""bigerageza gutanga inguzanyo."""
"""Some other countries, such as Zambia, [are] undergoing debt restructuring processes and an IMF program, and to me, this is the only way out of the crisis,"" Kanyama added."	"Kanyama yongeyeho ati: ""Ibindi bihugu bimwe na bimwe nka Zambiya, birimo guhindura imyenda na gahunda ya IMF, kandi kuri njye, iyi ni yo nzira yonyine yo kwikuramo ibibazo."""

WHO Says Africa's COVID Vaccinations Rose by 15% in February	Umuryango w'Abibumbye wita ku buzima uvuga ko inkingo za COVID zo muri Afrika zanduye 15% muri Gashyantare
The World Health Organization says Africas COVID-19 vaccinations rose by 15% between January and February, as several countries embarked on mass inoculation drives to expand coverage and protect populations from the pandemic.	Ishami ry'Umuryango w'Abibumbye ryita ku Buzima rivuga ko inkingo za Africas COVID-19 zazamutseho 15% hagati ya Mutarama na Gashyantare, mu gihe ibihugu byinshi byatangiye gahunda yo gukingira abantu benshi mu rwego rwo kwagura no kurinda abaturage icyorezo.
"Zimbabwes government says it is launching a ""national vaccination blitz"" targeting those who have not yet been vaccinated in a country where resistance to the shots has been an issue since the program started last year. The drive come amid government concern over rising COVID-19 cases. Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said in a statement that the increase in COVID-19 vaccinations on the continent was driven mainly by campaigns in populous countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria."	"Guverinoma ya Zimbabwes ivuga ko igiye gutangiza ""gukingira igihugu"" kwibasira abatarakingirwa mu gihugu aho ikibazo cyo kurwanya amasasu cyabaye ikibazo kuva gahunda yatangira umwaka ushize. Iyi gahunda ije mu gihe leta ihangayikishijwe no kwiyongera kwa COVID-19. Umuyobozi wa OMS mu karere ka Afurika, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, mu ijambo rye yavuze ko kwiyongera kw'inkingo za COVID-19 ku mugabane wa Afurika byatewe ahanini n'ubukangurambaga mu bihugu bituwe cyane, harimo Repubulika Iharanira Demokarasi ya Kongo, Etiyopiya, Kenya, na Nijeriya."
Dr. Thierno Balde, the WHO Africa regional COVID-19 incident manager, he says the continent must remain vigilant.	Dr. Thierno Balde, umuyobozi wa OMS mu karere ka COVID-19 ushinzwe ibikorwa, avuga ko umugabane ugomba gukomeza kuba maso.
"""We have seen what is happening around, in China, and the risk of also having new imitations, new variants still possible. We really need to continue to safeguard our population by taking the vaccine by not relaxing totally. The situation might change. So we really need to continue adapting some of these social measures and also to get vaccination,"" Balde said."	Twabonye ibibera hirya no hino, mu Bushinwa, ndetse n'akaga ko no kwigana ibintu bishya, ubundi buryo bushya buracyashoboka. Tugomba rwose gukomeza kurinda abaturage bacu dufata urukingo tutaruhuka rwose. Ibintu birashobora guhinduka. Rero Tugomba rwose gukomeza guhuza zimwe muri izo ngamba ndetse no gukingirwa , Balde.
The WHO said to boost African COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, it and other organizations were supporting mass vaccination drives in at least 10 priority countries to reach 100 million people by the end of next month.	Umuryango w'Abibumbye wita ku buzima yavuze ko bizamura urukingo rwa Afurika COVID-19, we n'indi miryango bashyigikiye gahunda yo gukingira imbaga byibuze mu bihugu 10 byihutirwa kugira ngo bigere ku bantu miliyoni 100 mu mpera z'ukwezi gutaha.
Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, Zimbabwes acting information minister, said his country would not be left behind.	Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, minisitiri w’agateganyo wa Zimbabwes, yavuze ko igihugu cye kitazasigara inyuma.
"""Regarding the vaccination program, as of 15 March, 2022, a total of 159,628 third doses have been administered to date. The national vaccination blitz campaign will kick off on Monday, 21 March, 2022, and [the] government is urging those that have not yet been vaccinated to take advantage of this exercise to do so,"" Ndlovu said."	Ku bijyanye na gahunda yo gukingira, guhera ku ya 15 Werurwe 2022, kugeza ubu hamaze gutangwa inshuro 159,628 zose za gatatu. Igikorwa cyo gukingira igihugu kizatangira ku wa mbere, 21 Werurwe 2022, kandi [guverinoma] irahamagarira abo ntibarakingirwa kugira ngo bakoreshe iyi myitozo kugira ngo babikore , Ndlovu.
A number of Zimbabweans have refused vaccination, saying they do not trust the mainly donated Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines. The country has lately recorded a rise in new infections – now cumulatively at 244,012 with 5,418 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the global outbreak.	Abatari bake bo muri Zimbabwe banze gukingirwa, bavuga ko batizeye inkingo za Sinopharm zakozwe mu Bushinwa na Sinovac. Nk’uko byatangajwe na kaminuza ya Johns Hopkins ikurikirana iki cyorezo ku isi, ngo iki gihugu kimaze iminsi cyiyongera ku banduye - ubu bakaba bagera kuri 244.012 bapfa 5.418.
Dr. Cleophas Chimbetete, president of Zimbabwe College of Public Health Physicians, attributes that to the recent lifting of restrictive measures, such as lockdowns. He says, however, it is not time to panic, just to enforce WHO protocols, such masking and social distancing.	Dr. Cleophas Chimbetete, perezida w’ishuri rikuru ry’abaganga b’ubuzima rusange rya Zimbabwe, avuga ko ibyo biterwa no gukuraho ingamba zihamye nko gufunga. Avuga ko ariko, atari igihe cyo guhagarika umutima, gusa ngo dushyire mu bikorwa protocole ya OMS, nko guhisha no gutandukanya imibereho.
"""After relaxing measures, it is expected that cases will slightly go up. But I also think that it is too early to make any meaningful conclusions, I think it is just an opportunity for us to strengthen our preventative measures and continue highlighting to the rest of the population that COVID is still with us. The good news, though, is that severe cases have not gone up. What we need to do is to continue to get vaccinated and what is important is that the government should – as it is doing – is monitor these numbers. There is no cause for alarm or cause for us to introduce new measures,"" Chimbetete said."	Nyuma yo gufata ingamba zo kuruhuka, biteganijwe ko imanza zizamuka ho gato. Ariko nanone ndatekereza ko hakiri kare gufata imyanzuro ifatika, ndatekereza ko ari amahirwe kuri twe gushimangira ingamba zo gukumira no gukomeza kumurikira abandi. y'abaturage ko COVID ikiri kumwe natwe.Inkuru nziza, nubwo, imanza zikomeye zitigeze ziyongera.

Nta mpamvu yo gutabaza cyangwa kudutera gushyiraho ingamba nshya , Chimbetete.
Zimbabwe had a target of vaccinating at least 10 million people by the end of last year, a figure that some say was difficult to reach given the scarcity of resources and hesitance. It has yet to announce when it plans to achieve herd immunity.	Mu mpera z'umwaka ushize, Zimbabwe yari ifite intego yo gukingira byibuze miliyoni 10 z'abantu, iyo mibare bamwe bavuga ko bigoye kuyigeraho bitewe n'ubushobozi buke no gushidikanya.

Kugwa kwinshi kumeza yibyishimo byisi, byashyizwe ahagaragara kuwa gatanu, byaje muri Libani, Venezuwela na Afuganisitani.
Lebanon, which is facing economic meltdown, fell to second from last on the index of 146 nations, just below Zimbabwe.	Libani ihura n’ubukungu bwifashe nabi, yagabanutse ku mwanya wa kabiri kuva ku rutonde rw’ibihugu 146, munsi ya Zimbabwe.
War-traumatized Afghanistan, already bottom of the table, has seen its humanitarian crisis deepen since the Taliban took power again last August.

A court in Zimbabwe dismissed a discharge application Tuesday in a case against a New York Times journalist. Freelance journalist Jeffrey Moyo is accused of flouting Zimbabwe's immigration laws when he allegedly helped two foreign reporters enter the southern African nation illegally last year.

That's our position,"" Mangwana said."	Turashaka gusa kubona ko hari amategeko n'amabwiriza.

Zimbabwe Police Block Main Opposition Rallies	Abapolisi ba Zimbabwe bahagaritse imyigaragambyo y’abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi
Zimbabwe police Saturday blocked the country's main opposition party from holding rallies ahead of March 26 elections to fill seats that have fallen vacant since the general election in 2018. The police says the rally ban in Mavhunga, about 80 kilometers east of Harare, is meant to ensure peace and stability.

He told his supporters he does not want the politics of Zimbabwe to cause any death. Then he added that what the government does not know is that here in Marondera, his arrival is good enough.	Chamisa yavuze ko ishyaka rye ridashaka kurwana n'abantu. Yavuze ko guverinoma yanze uruhushya rwo gukora imyigaragambyo, bityo ishyaka risaba uruhushya rwo kuza kubivuga.

"""Our rally in Marondera was purportedly banned and yet ZANU-PF was car rally and other unsanctioned in the very same area,"" she said. ""Not once have they sought authorization or given notice to the police, yet these unlawful prohibitions are meted out against us. Ours is a struggle of non-violent resistance. However, the thousands that came out just to hear president Chamisa speak shows beyond any doubt that the citizens are prepared to do whatever it takes to reclaim their dignity. We continue to urge supporters to register to vote in their masses so that we attain our target in 2023: A landslide victory."""	"Ati: ""Imyigaragambyo yacu i Marondera byavuzwe ko yabujijwe nyamara ZANU-PF yari igiterane cy'imodoka ndetse n'ibindi bitemewe mu gace kamwe.""

Turakomeza gusaba abayoboke kwiyandikisha kugira ngo batore mu mbaga yabo kugira ngo tugere ku ntego yacu mu 2023: Intsinzi idasanzwe. """
Zimbabwe police Sunday refused to comment on the ban of the Citizens Coalition for Change in Marondera. It issued a letter to the opposition saying it needed time to prepare to ensure there was peace at the rally. Two weeks ago, violence instigated by suspected ruling ZANU-PF supporters at a Citizens Coalition for Change rally resulted in two deaths and dozens injured.	Ku cyumweru abapolisi ba Zimbabwe banze kugira icyo batangaza ku ihagarikwa ry’abenegihugu baharanira impinduka muri Marondera. Yasohoye ibaruwa abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi ivuga ko hakenewe igihe cyo kwitegura kugira ngo imyigaragambyo ibe amahoro.

A Zimbabwe Court Dismisses Suspension of Striking Teachers	Urukiko rwa Zimbabwe rwanze ihagarikwa ry’abarimu bigaragambyaga
Zimbabwe's High Court has voided the government's three-month suspension of striking teachers, ruling the ministry of education overstepped its authority. The teachers went on strike last week over poor salaries just as schools were set to reopen after a long break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysts say children's education has been caught in the crossfire.

"""We managed to present our arguments before the court and the judge has given us an order to the effect that the press statement that was issued by the minister of primary and secondary education is illegal and unconstitutional,"" said Chinhanu. ""We managed to prove that our client has a right not to be suspended in such a manner which was in violation of public service regulations of the nation."""	"Chinhanu yagize ati: ""Twashoboye gutanga ibitekerezo byacu imbere y'urukiko kandi umucamanza yaduhaye itegeko kugira ngo itangazo ry'abanyamakuru ryatanzwe na minisitiri w'amashuri abanza n'ayisumbuye bitemewe kandi binyuranyije n'Itegeko Nshinga.""

Gibson Nyikadzino, umusesenguzi wa politiki wigenga, avuga ko guverinoma n'abarimu bagomba gukemura vuba imyigaragambyo kuko abanyeshuri bakomeje gutsindwa.
"""We are seeing a lot of agitation and politicization of this from the employees,"" said Nyikadzino. ""They are not keen to listen to what the employer is saying. Their parties that are being affected as a result of this, so what has to be done is go to the tripartite negotiating forum and in the spirit find a consensus."""	"Nyikadzino ati: ""Turimo kubona imyigaragambyo myinshi na politiki mu bakozi."" ""Ntabwo bashishikajwe no kumva ibyo umukoresha avuga. Amashyaka yabo agira ingaruka kuri ibyo, bityo rero ikigomba gukorwa ni ukujya mu ihuriro ry’ibiganiro bitatu kandi mu mwuka ugashaka ubwumvikane."""

"""There are some members who are unable to travel: those who are far distant schools. They are finding it difficult because of the resources,"" said Ndlovu. ""And there are some who are saying while we are within the school environs, we still find it difficult to find food for subsistence. That is what is mitigating against 100 percent attendance. We hope that after pay day (next week Tuesday) things will get back to normal. But that does not mean that the teachers are happy with the remuneration that they are getting.

The pay dispute goes back to October 2018, when the government stopped paying civil servants in U.S. dollars, switching to the reintroduced Zimbabwean dollar. The new currency has steadily lost value, effectively reducing teacher wages to about $100 a month. The teachers want the $540 a month they were getting in 2018.	Impaka z’imishahara zisubira mu Kwakira 2018, igihe guverinoma yahagaritse kwishyura abakozi ba Leta mu madorari y’Amerika, ihindura amadorari ya Zimbabwe. Ifaranga rishya ryatakaje agaciro, kugabanya umushahara wa mwarimu kugera ku madolari 100 ku kwezi. Abarimu bifuza amadorari 540 ku kwezi babonaga muri 2018.
Last week the teachers rejected the governments offer of a 20 percent pay raise along with some incentives, such as housing loans.	Mu cyumweru gishize abarimu banze ko leta itanga umushahara wa 20 ku ijana hamwe n’ingamba zimwe na zimwe, nk’inguzanyo zamazu.

In a statement this week, President Emmerson Mnangagwas government said it wants its employees to resume meeting in person. Late Tuesday, Monica Mutsvangwa, the countrys information minister, said the number of people being hospitalized for COVID-19 is on a steady decline.	Mu ijambo rye kuri iki cyumweru, guverinoma ya Perezida Emmerson Mnangagwas yavuze ko ishaka ko abakozi bayo bakomeza inama ku giti cyabo. Ku wa kabiri, Minica Mutsvangwa, minisitiri w’itangazamakuru mu gihugu, yavuze ko umubare w’abantu bari mu bitaro bya COVID-19 ugenda ugabanuka.
"""This indicates that the national response measures instituted by government continue to pay off. …In view of the continued decline in new cases and deaths, coupled with a declining testing positivity rate that is indicating that the community transmission has gone down, all ports of entry [are to] be reopened, but ensuring that all the recommended COVID-19 prevention measures are adhered to,"" she said."

Obert Masaraure, the president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, says the workers will take the matter to court if the government insists.	Obert Masaraure, perezida w’ishyirahamwe ry’abarimu bo mu cyaro cya Amalgamated Zimbabwe, avuga ko abakozi bazabishyikiriza urukiko niba leta ishimangiye.
"""A contract that was signed by civil servants has no provision for mandatory vaccination."	Amasezerano yashyizweho umukono n'abakozi ba Leta nta tegeko ryo gukingirwa ku gahato. Niba rero komisiyo ishinzwe abakozi ba leta ishaka kubuza abakozi ba leta badakingiwe, barenze ku masezerano kandi ntibyemewe.

One such student, a 16-year-old, said, ""My appeal [to the government] is for a salary increment for teachers so that they come to work, because we arent learning. Its like we are paying fees for nothing. Its so painful as my parents are struggling for it when I am not learning at all."""	"Hagati aho, hari bamwe mu rubyiruko biga mu mashuri yigenga. Umwe mu banyeshuri nk'abo, ufite imyaka 16, yagize ati: ""Icyifuzo cyanjye [kuri guverinoma] ni ukongera umushahara ku barimu kugira ngo baze ku kazi, kuko twatangiye amashuri yaratangiye. Bisa nkaho twishyurira ubusa. Birababaje  cyane kubona ababyeyi banjye bakora ibishoboka byose ngo nige,  ariko nkaba ntarimo kwiga na gato. """
The pay dispute goes back to October 2018, when the government stopped paying teachers in U.S. dollars, switching to the reintroduced Zimbabwean dollar. The new currency has steadily lost value, effectively reducing teachers' wages.	Imishahara ya mbere y'ukwezi k' UKwakira 2018, igihe guverinoma yahagarikaga kwishyura abarimu mu madorari y'Abanyamerika, ahubwo ikabishyura mu madorari ya Zimbabwe. Ifaranga rishya ryatakaje agaciro, bituma umushahara wabo ugabanuka.
Obert Masaraure, president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, said the instructors want their old salaries restored and that the offer of a 20 percent raise amounted to almost nothing.	Obert Masaraure, perezida w’urugaga rw ’abarimu bo mu cyaro cya Amalgamated muri Zimbabwe, yasabye imishahara y'abarimu ya mbere  yavugururwa kandi ko inyongera  ya 20 ku ijana nta kintu na kimwe imaze.
"""We asked for the restoration of salaries, which were robbed from us by the government of the day,"" Masaraure said. ""And the message to the government is clear: We need our pre-October 2018 salaries of 540 dollars U.S. We know these shenanigans of adding an extra dollar to our salaries — that does not add up."""	"Masaraure ati: ""Twasabye guverinoma iriho kuvugurura imishahara tugahabwa umushahara wari uriho mbere Kandi ubutumwa kuri guverinoma burasobanutse: Dukeneye imishahara ibanziriza Ukwakira 2018 y'amadorari 540 y'Abanyamerika. Turabizi iyi gahunda  yo kongera amadorari  ku mushahara - ibyo ntacyo bifasha."""
Government officials see the ongoing talks in a different light and voice optimism about a successful resolution.	Abayobozi ba leta bakomeje ibiganiro mu buryo butandukanye kandi bafite icyizere cyo gukemura  iki kibazo  neza.
"Paul Mavima, Zimbabwe's minister of public service, labor and social welfare, said, ""In many ways we already have a breakthrough. The leaders of the workers have to a very large extent welcomed this package and they are only saying: Lets discuss how it is going to be implemented."""	"Minisitiri w’imirimo ifitiye igihugu akamaro, umurimo n’imibereho myiza y’abaturage muri Zimbabwe, Paul Mavima, yagize ati:  Tumaze gutera intambwe mu nzira zitandukanye zo gukemura ibibazo. Abakoresha bagomba kwishimira cyane iyi gahunda bagafata umwanya wo kuganira ku buryo igiye gushyirwa mu bikorwa. """
The teachers and government are expected to meet in coming days to resume negotiations. Meanwhile, students wait to resume their studies months after the COVID-19 pandemic forced their schools to close.	Biteganijwe ko abarimu na guverinoma bazahura mu minsi iri imbere kugira ngo bakomeze ibiganiro. Hagati aho, abanyeshuri bategereje gukomeza amasomo yabo nyuma y'amezi ashize batiga kubera icyorezo cya COVID-19 cyatumye amashuri afunga.
Private Military Contractors Bolster Russian Influence in Africa	Abasirikare bigenga bita Bolster bo mu burusiya bagira uruhare muri Afrika
"Russia's geopolitical ambitions in Africa have in recent years been backed by private military contractors, often described as belonging to the ""Wagner group"" — an entity with no known legal status."	" Intego z’uburusiya muri Afurika muri iyi myaka yashize zashyigikiwe n’abasirikare bigenga, bakunze kuvuga ko bari mu itsinda rya ""Wagner"" - umuryango bivugwa ko udafite ubuzima gatozi."
Most recently, Western nations have condemned the alleged arrival of Russian mercenaries in Mali's capital Bamako, a claim denied by the junta that seized power in 2020.	Vuba aha, ibihugu by’iburengerazuba byamaganye ibivugwa ko haje abacanshuro b’Uburusiya mu murwa mukuru wa Mali Bamako,iki kirego kikaba cyarahakanywe na Junta wafashe ubutegetsi mu 2020.
As relations with France worsen, the military rulers may be looking for ways to make up for shrinking numbers of European troops fighting Mali's years-old jihadist insurgency.	Mugihe umubano n’Ubufaransa urushijeho kuba mubi, abategetsi b’igisirikare bashobora kuba bashaka uburyo bwo kugabanya umubare w’ingabo z’i Burayi zirwanya inyeshyamba za Jihadiste zimazeyo  imyaka n' imyaka.
"""Mercs [mercenaries] working in Africa is an established norm"" thanks in part to decades of operations by contractors from South Africa, said Jason Blazakis of the New York-based Soufan Group think tank."	"Jason Blazakis wo mu kigo gifasha mu gutekereza cya Soufan Group gikorera i New York yagize ati: ""Abacanshuro  bakorera muri Afurika ni itegeko  ryashyizweho""."
"""The Wagner folks are walking through a door that has long been open to their ilk,"" he added."	"Yongeyeho ati: ""Umuryango umaze igihe kinini ufunguye ku bantu bashaja kwinjira muri Wagner"""""
No information is publicly available about the group's size or finances.	Nta makuru yashyizwe ahagaragara kubyerekeye ingano y' abagize iri tsinda cyangwa kubijyanye n'imari yaryo.
But around Africa, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington has found evidence since 2016 of Russian soldiers of fortune in Sudan, South Sudan, Libya, the Central African Republic (CAR), Madagascar and Mozambique.	Ariko hirya no hino muri Afurika, Ikigo gishinzwe ibijyanye n'ubushakashatsi mpuzamahanga (CSIS) i Washington cyabonye ibimenyetso kuva mu 2016 by’abasirikare b’Uburusiya bagiye  muri Sudani, Sudani yepfo, Libiya, Repubulika ya Centrafrique (CAR), Madagasikari na Mozambike.
Botswana, Burundi, Chad, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria and Zimbabwe are also on the CSIS's list.	Botswana, Burundi, Tchad, Comoros, Repubulika Iharanira Demokarasi ya Kongo, Congo-Brazzaville, Gineya, Gineya-Bissau, Nijeriya na Zimbabwe na byo biri ku rutonde rw'ibihugu bizagibwamo na CSIS.
"In Africa ""there is a convergence of many states' interests, including China's,"" Alexey Mukhin of the Moscow-based Centre for Political Information told AFP."	"Alexey Mukhin wo mu kigo gishinzwe amakuru ya politiki i Moscou yabwiye ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abafaransa ati: ""Muri Afurika"" hari ihuriro ry' ibihugu byinshi’i z’ibihugu byinshi rigamije iterambere  harimo n’Ubushinwa. """
"""Every state has the right to defend its business assets,"" he added."	"Yongeyeho ati: ""Buri gihugu gifite uburenganzira bwo kurengera umutungo wacyo mu bucuruzi ."""
Wagner does not officially exist, with no company registration, tax returns or organizational chart to be found.	Wagner ntabwo izwi  kumugaragaro, si sosiyete yanditswe izwi,ntigaragaza imisoro itanga cyangwa inzego zayo z'ubuyobozi.
When the EU wanted to sanction the group in 2020, it targeted Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin who is suspected of running Wagner.	Igihe Umuryango w'ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi washakaga kwemerera uyu mutwe mu 2020, wibasiwe na  oligarch wo mu Burusiya Yevgeny Prigozhin, umufasha wa Perezida Vladimir Putin akaba akekwaho kuyobora Wagner.
"It imposed further sanctions in December last year when mercenaries' arrival in Mali appeared certain — drawing accusations of ""hysteria"" from Moscow."	"Wongeye gufatirwa ibihano mu Kuboza umwaka ushize ubwo abacanshuro byagaragaye ko bageze  muri Mali.  bashinja ""hysteria"" i Moscou."
Western experts say military contractors are embedded in Russia's official forces like intelligence agencies and the army, providing plausible deniability for Moscow.	Impuguke z’iburengerazuba zivuga ko ingabo za gisirikare zinjiye mu butegetsi bw’Uburusiya nk’inzego z’ubutasi n’ingabo, ibyo ariko Moscou ikabihakana.
"Their deployment to African countries aims to ""enable Russia to... regain this sphere of influence"" that fell away with the collapse of the Soviet Union, said CSIS researcher Catrina Doxsee."	"Koherezwa kwabo mu bihugu bya Afurika bigamije ""gutuma Uburusiya buzahuka... kugira ngo buzahure ubukungu  bwagizweho ingaruka no gusenyuka kw'Abasoviyeti, nk'uko byatangajwe n'umushakashatsi wa CSIS, Catrina Doxsee."
The mercenaries' presence has been growing even faster since a 2019 Russia-Africa summit.	Abacanshuro bariyongereye cyane kuva  2019aho inama nyafurika n'uburusiya itangiriye..
"Moscow has been active ""especially in what has traditionally been France's zone of influence"" in former colonies like CAR and Mali, said Djallil Lounnas, a researcher at Morocco's Al Akhawayn university."	"Djallil Lounnas, umushakashatsi muri kaminuza ya Al Akhawayn ya Maroc, yatangaje ko Moscou yagize uruhare ""cyane cyane mu byahoze ari akarere k’Ubufaransa""."
"While military contractors sometimes shepherd Russian arms sales, the revenue ""really pales compared with the profit they are able to generate from mining concessions and access to natural resources,"" Doxsee said."	"Doxsee yagize ati: ""Nubwo abashoramari rimwe na rimwe bagerageza kugurisha ibirwanisho by’Uburusiya, amafaranga binjiza ni make  rwose ugereranije n’inyungu bashobora kubona mu bucukuzi bw’amabuye y'agaciro no kubona umutungo kamere ""."
That makes unstable countries with mineral or hydrocarbon wealth prime customers — such as in Syria where the mercenaries first became known to the wider public.	Ibyo bituma ibihugu bifite ubutunzi kamere bihungabana kandi byari bifite abakiriya ba mbere. Twavuga muri rusange  nko muri Siriya aho abacanshuro bamenyekanye bwa mbere.
No questions asked	Nta kibazo cyabajijwe
Lounnas said that another advantage for clients is a lack of friction over human rights and democracy that might come with Western partners.	Lounnas yavuze ko indi nyungu ku bakiriya ari ukutumvikana kukijyanye n' uburenganzira bwa muntu na demokarasi bishobora kuzanwa n'abafatanyabikorwa bo mu Burengerazuba.
"""Russia has its interests. It doesn't ask questions,"" he added."	"Yongeyeho ati: ""Uburusiya bufite inyungu zabwo. Ntabwo bubaza ibibazo""."
Reports of violence and abuse on the ground suggest that same latitude may extend to the mercenaries themselves.	Raporo  z' ihohoterwa hanze aha zerekana ko uburinganire bushobora kugera no kubikorera ubwabo.
In the CAR, the United Nations is probing an alleged massacre during a joint operation by government forces and Wagner fighters.	Muri CAR, Umuryango w’abibumbye urimo gukora iperereza ku bwicanyi bwabaye hagati y'ingabo za leta n’abarwanyi ba Wagner.
"One military source told AFP that more than 50 people died, some in ""summary executions."""	"Hari igitabo kimwe cya gisirikare cyatangarije AFP ko abantu barenga 50 bapfuye, mucyo bise ""kwicwa muri make."""
On Thursday, the European Union said it would not resume military training in the CAR — suspended since mid-December — unless the country's soldiers stop working for Wagner.	Ku wa kane, Umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi wavuze ko utazongera imyitozo ya gisirikare muri CAR - yahagaritswe kuva hagati mu Kuboza - keretse igihe  abasirikare b’iki gihugu bazaba bahagaritse gukorera Wagner.
Meanwhile the mercenaries' results do not always measure up to the hopes of the governments that hire them.	Hagati aho ariko, ibikorwa by'abacanshuro ntabwo buri gihe bisibiza ibyifuzo bya guverinoma iba yabahaye akazi.
In Libya, Russian mercenaries suffered heavy losses in Marshal Khalifa Haftar's year-long attempt to conquer the capital Tripoli, which was ultimately unsuccessful.	Muri Libiya, abacanshuro b'Abarusiya bagize igihombo kinini muri Marshal Khalifa Haftar umwaka wose kukon bagerageje kwigarurira umurwa mukuru Tripoli, ariko ntibyashoboka.
And in Mozambique, the Russians retreated in the face of Islamic State group jihadists, ultimately losing out to South African competitors.	Kandi muri Mozambike, Abarusiya igihe bari bateganye n' abajihadiste bo mu mutwe wa kisilamu basubira inyuma, nyuma baza nabo gutsindwa n’abarwanyi ba Afurika yepfo.
"Although lacking language skills and experience with the terrain, Wagner ""were picked because they were the cheapest"", Doxsee said."	"Doxsee yavuze ko nubwo badafite ubumenyi bw’ururimi n'uburambe kuri ubu butaka, Wagner ""batoranijwe kubera ko ari bo bahendutse""."
"""They didn't have what it took to succeed,"" she added, noting that ""they've had a fair few failures"" across Africa."	"Yongeyeho ati: ""Ntabwo bari bafite icyo basabwa kugira ngo batsinde."" Yongeyeho ko ""batsinzwe bitari bike"" muri Afurika."
Succeeding completely might actually harm the mercenaries' business model, which thrives on unrest, conflict and crisis.	Intsinzi irashobora rwose kwangiza ibikorwa byubucuruzi bwabacanshuro, bitera imbere mumidugararo, amakimbirane nibibazo.
"""If a country such as the CAR hires them to train forces, to help them in their military efforts, its in their interest to accomplish that just well enough to continue to be employed,"" Doxsee said."	"Doxsee ati: ""Niba igihugu nka CAR kibahaye akazi ko gutoza ingabo, no kubafasha mu bikorwa byabo bya gisirikare, ni ngombwa kubahiriza izo nshingano kugira ngo bakomeze guhabwa akazi""."
"""If they actually were to do it well enough to resolve the conflict, they would no longer be needed."""	Baramutse babikoze neza bagakemura amakimbirane, ntibakongera gukenerwa
