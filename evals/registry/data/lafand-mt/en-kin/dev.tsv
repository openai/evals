Cyclone Batsirai Weakens After Hitting Madagascar, Floods Feared	Inkubi y'umuyaga mwinshi bise cyclone Batsirai wagabanutse  Nyuma yo Guhuha muri Madagasikari ugateza umwuzure
Cyclone Batsirai weakened overnight but floods were still expected due to heavy rain after it hit eastern Madagascar with strong winds, the island's meteorological office said Sunday.	Ibiro by'iteganyagihe kuri iki kirwa byatangaje ko ku cyumweru inkubi y'umuyaga Batsirai yagabanutse ariko ko hateganijwe umwuzure kubera imvura nyinshi ivanze n'umuyaga yibasiye uburasirazuba bwa Madagasikari.
"""Batsirai has weakened,"" Meteo Madagascar said, adding that the cyclone's average wind speed had almost halved to 80 kph, while the strongest gusts had scaled back to 110 kph from the 235 kph recorded when it made landfall on Saturday evening."	"Ikigo gishinzwe iteganyagihe muri Madagascar cyagize kiti: ""Batsirai yagabanutse"" Yongeyeho ko umuvuduko ukabije w’umuyaga wari wikubye kabiri kugera kuri 80 kph,kuko umuyaga mwinshi wagabanutse kugera kuri 110 kph kuri 235 kph  ku mugoroba wo ku wa Gatandatu."
The cyclone, the second storm to hit the large Indian Ocean island nation in just a few weeks, was moving westwards at a rate of 19 kph, the meteorological services said.	Serivisi z’iteganyagihe zavuze ko inkubi y'umuyaga, inkubi y'umuyaga ya kabiri yibasiye igihugu kinini cyegereye  inyanja y'Abahinde mu byumweru bike gusa, yaganaga iburengerazuba ku kigero cya 19 kph.
"But ""localized or generalized floods are still feared following the heavy rains,"" it said, adding that Batsirai should emerge at sea in the Mozambique Channel later Sunday."	"Ati: ""Ariko imyuzure muri rusange iracyateye ubwoba kuko hateganijwe imvura nyinshi"", ikomeza ivuga ko Batsirai izagera mu nyanja igana kuri  Mozambique nyuma yicyumweru."
Batsirai made landfall in Mananjary district, more than 530 kilometers southeast of the capital Antananarivo, around 8 p.m. local time (1700 GMT) Saturday.	Batsirai yageze mu karere ka Mananjary, mu birometero birenga 530 mu majyepfo y’umurwa mukuru Antananarivo, ahagana mu ma saa munani. Isaha yaho (1700 GMT) Kuwa Gatandatu.
"It reached the island as an ""intense tropical cyclone"", packing winds of 165 kph, Faly Aritiana Fabien of the country's disaster management agency told AFP."	Faly Aritiana Fabien wo mu kigo gishinzwe imicungire y’ibiza yatangarije ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abafaransa (AFP) agira ati:
"The national meteorological office has said it fears ""significant and widespread damage."""	"Ikigo cy’igihugu cy’iteganyagihe cyatangaje ko gifitiye ubwoba ukwangirika gukabije kugiye kuba."""
Just an hour and a half after it first hit land, nearly 27,000 people had been counted as displaced from their homes, Fabien said.	Fabien yavuze ko nyuma y'isaha imwe n'igice ubutaka buri bwibasirwe,abantu bagakurwa mubyabo, asaba ko abagera ku 27.000 bagomba kuba bavanywe aho.
He said his office has accommodation sites, food and medical care ready for victims, as well as search and rescue plans already in place.	Yavuze ko ibiro bye bifite aho gucumbika, ibyo kurya ndetse n’ubuvuzi byiteguye kwakira abahohotewe, ndetse na gahunda yo gukurikirana no gutabara bimaze gutegurwa.
Very serious threat'	umutingito ukomeye'
"The Meteo-France weather service had earlier predicted Batsirai would present ""a very serious threat"" to Madagascar, after passing Mauritius and drenching the French island of La Reunion with torrential rain for two days."	Serivisi ishinzwe ikirere cya mu bufaransa yari yavuze yuko Batsirai ikomeye izaboneka muri Madagasikari ivuye muri Maurice kandi ko hazaba umuhengeri muri La Reunion mu Bufaransa ukazamara iminsi ibiri.
In the hours before the cyclone hit, residents hunkered down in the impoverished country, still recovering from the deadly Tropical Storm Ana late last month.	Mu masaha make mbere yuko inkubi y'umuyaga yibasira abantu,  abaturage bahungiye mu gihugu gikennye, bari  kuva muri Tropical Storm kuko hari abantu yari yishe mu mpera z'ukwezi gushize.
In the eastern coastal town of Vatomandry, more than 200 people were crammed in one room in a Chinese-owned concrete building.	Mu mujyi wa Vatomandry uri mu burasirazuba bw'inyanja, abantu barenga 200 bashyizwe ahantu hamwe bita Beto mu nzu imwe y'abashinwa.
Families slept on mats or mattresses.	Imiryango yararaga ku misambi cyangwa kuri za matora.
Community leader Thierry Louison Leaby lamented the lack of clean water after the water utility company turned off supplies ahead of the cyclone.	Umuyobozi w’abaturage, Thierry Louison Leaby, yinubiye ko nta mazi meza babona nyuma y’uko ikigo gishinzwe iby' amazi cyahagaritse gukomeza kuyatanga mbere y'inkubi y' umuyaga.
"""People are cooking with dirty water,"" he said, amid fears of a diarrhea outbreak."	"Ati: ""Abantu barimo gutekesha amazi mabi"", Dufite ubwoba bwo kwandura 'indwara y'impiswi."
Outside plastic dishes and buckets were placed in a line to catch rainwater dripping from the corrugated roofing sheets.	Hanze hashyizweyo ibikoresho  bya pulasitike harimo indobo  kugirango amazi y'imvura agwemo avuye ku mabati.

Cyclone still 'dangerous'	Inkubi y'umuyaga iracyateje akaga
Other residents of Vatomandry were stockpiling supplies in preparation for the storm.	Abandi baturage ba Vatomandry bari guteganya ibikoresho kugirango bitegure umuyaga.
"""We have been stocking up for a week, rice but also grains because with the electricity cuts we cannot keep meat or fish,"" said Odette Nirina, a 65-year-old hotelier in Vatomandry."	"Odette Nirina ukora muri Hoteri muri Vatomandry, ufite imyaka 65 y'amavuko  yagize ati: ""Tumaze icyumweru duhunitse umuceri n' ingano ariko kuko umuriro w' amashanyarazi wabuze ntidushobora kubika inyama cyangwa amafi""."
"""I have also stocked up on coal. Here we are used to cyclones,"" she told AFP."	"Yabwiye  AFP ati: ""Nanjye nabitse amakara. Hano tumenyereye inkubi y'umuyaga."""
Winds of more than 50 kph pummeled Vatomandry on Saturday morning, accompanied by intermittent rain.	Umuyaga uvanze n' imvura nkeya urenga 50 kph wasunitse Vatomandry mu gitondo cyo kuwa Gatandatu.
"The disaster agency said the cyclone was expected to remain ""dangerous"" as it swept across the large island overnight and in the morning."	Ikigo gishinzwe ibiza cyavuze ko hateganijwe  inkubi y'umuyaga izakomeza guteza akaga kuko yambukiranya ikirwa kinini amanywa n' ijoro
Flooding is expected due to excessive rainfall in the east, southeast and central regions of the country, it warned.	Biteganijwe ko hazaba umwuzure kubera imvura nyinshi yo mu burasirazuba, mu majyepfo y’iburasirazuba no hagati mu gihugu.
The United Nations was ramping up its preparedness with aid agencies, placing rescue aircraft on standby and stockpiling humanitarian supplies.	Umuryango w’abibumbye ufatanije  n’inzego z’ubutabazi, uri gutegura indege z’ubutabazi n' ibikoresho by' ubutabazi.
At least 131,000 people were affected by Ana across Madagascar in late January. Close to 60 people were killed, mostly in the capital Antananarivo.	Nibura abantu 131.000 bibasiwe na Ana hirya no hino muri Madagasikari mu mpera za Mutarama. Abantu bagera kuri 60 bitabye imana cyane cyane mu murwa mukuru Antananarivo.

The U.N.'s World Food Program pointed to estimates from national authorities that some 595,000 people could be directly affected by Batsirai, and 150,000 more might be displaced due to new landslides and flooding.	Umuryango w'abibumye ushinzwe inkunga y'ibiribwa ku isi yagaragaje ibigereranyo byatanzwe n’ubuyobozi bw’igihugu ko abantu 595.000 bashobora kwibasirwa na Batsirai, naho abandi 150.000 bakaba bashobora kuvanwa mubyabo kubera inkangu igiye kuza n’umwuzure.

US Catholic Clergy Shortage Eased by Recruits From Africa	Ubuke bw'abayobozi b'amadini gatolika bo muri Amerika bwatewe nuko  baza muri Afurika
The Rev. Athanasius Chidi Abanulo — using skills honed in his African homeland to minister effectively in rural Alabama— determines just how long he can stretch out his Sunday homilies based on who is sitting in the pews.	Nyiricyubahiro Athanasius Chidi Abanulo  Muri Afurika- akoresha ubuhanga cyane kugira ngo akorere neza mu cyaro cya Alabama - agena igihe ashobora gusura imiryango  ku cyumweru ahereye ku uwubabaye.
"Seven minutes is the sweet spot for the mostly white and retired parishioners who attend the English-language Mass at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in the small town of Wedowee. ""If you go beyond that, you lose the attention of the people,"" he said."	"Iminota irindwi ni myiza kubazungu bera kandi bari mukiruhuko k'izabukuru mu kwitabira itabira misa yo mu cyongereza kuri Kiliziya Gatolika yitwa Immaculate Conception iri mu mujyi muto wa Wedowee. Ati: ""ibirenze kuri ibyo, byaba ari ukutita kubaturage ""."
"For the Spanish-language Mass an hour later, the Nigerian-born priest — one of numerous African clergy serving in the U.S. — knows he can quadruple his teaching time. ""The more you preach, the better for them,"" he said."	"Nyuma yisaga imwe Misa yo mu Cyesipanyoli irangiye, umupadiri wavukiye muri Nijeriya - umwe mu bapadiri benshi bo muri Afurika bakorera muri Amerika - azi ko ashobora gukuba hafi inshuro enye igihe cyo kwigisha. Ati: ""Nukomeza kubwiriza, ni byiza kuri bo."""
As he moves from one American post to the next, Abanulo has learned how to tailor his ministry to the culture of the communities he is serving while infusing some of the spirit of his homeland into the universal rhythms of the Mass.	Mu gihe avuye kumwanya umwe w'umunyamerika akajya kuwundi, Abanulo yashakishije uburyo ahuza akazi n'umuco w'abaturage akorera kugira ngo azane umwuka mwiza w'ubwumvikane muri Misa.
"""Nigerian people are relaxed when they come to church,"" Abanulo said. ""They love to sing, they love to dance. The liturgy can last for two hours. They don't worry about that."""	"Abanulo ati: ""Abanyanijeriya bararuhuka iyo baje mu rusengero."" ""Bakunda kuririmba, bakunda kubyina. Liturujiya ishobora kumara amasaha abiri. Ubona ko ntacyo bibatwaye."""
During his 18 years in the U.S., Abanulo has filled various chaplain and pastor roles across the country, epitomizing an ongoing trend in the American Catholic church. As fewer American-born men and women enter seminaries and convents, U.S. dioceses and Catholic institutions have turned to international recruitment to fill their vacancies.	Mu myaka 18 yamaze muri Amerika, Abanulo yujuje inshingano zitandukanye z'abapadiri n'abapasitori mu gihugu hose, akomeza guteza imbere amahame ya kiliziya Gatolika y'Abanyamerika. Mu gihe abagabo n'abagore bake bavukiye muri Amerika binjira mu maseminari no mu makoraniro, diyosezi zo muri Amerika hamwe n’ibigo gatolika byahinduye abakozi mpuzamahanga kugira ngo babone imyanya yabo.
The Diocese of Birmingham, where Abanulo leads two parishes, has widened its search for clergy to places with burgeoning religious vocations like Nigeria and Cameroon, said Birmingham Bishop Steven Raica. Priests from Africa were also vital in the Michigan diocese where Raica previously served.	Diocese ya Birmingham, Steven Raica, yatangaje ko Diyosezi ya Birmingham, aho Abanulo ayoboye paruwasi ebyiri, iri gushakisha abapadiri bayobora ahantu bahuje imyizerere nko muri Nigeriya na Kameruni. Abapadiri bo muri Afurika nabo ni  ingenzi muri diyosezi ya Michigan aho Raica yakoreraga mbere.
"""They have been an enormous help to us to be able to provide the breadth and scope of ministry that we have available to us,"" he said."	"Ati: ""Byadufashije cyane kugira ngo tubashe kwigisha ubutumwa bwiza."
"Africa is the Catholic church's fastest-growing region. There, the seminaries are ""fairly full,"" said the Rev. Thomas Gaunt, director of Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, which conducts research about the Catholic church."	"Muri Afurika, abakirisitu ba kiliziya gatolija bari kugenda biyongera. Kuko rwose hari na za seminari zuzuye "", nk'uko byatangajwe na nyiricyubahiro Thomas Gaunt, umuyobozi w'ikigo cya kaminuza ya Georgetown gishinzwe ubushakashatsi bukoreshwa muri Apostolate, gikora ubushakashatsi kuri kiliziya gatolika."
Falling numbers	Kugabanuka
It's different in the U.S. where the Catholic church faces significant hurdles in recruiting home-grown clergy following decades of declining church attendance and the damaging effects of widespread clergy sex abuse scandals.	Bitandukanye cyane no muri Amerika aho kiliziya Gatolika ihura n'imbogamizi zikomeye zo kujyana abapadiri bashaje mu kiruhuko k'izabukuru bagejeje ku myaka  ibarirwa muri za mirongo batitaye kungaruka  mbi ziterwa n’ihohoterwa rishingiye ku gitsina ry’abapadiri baba barakorewe.
Catholic women and married men remain barred from the priesthood; arguments that lifting those bans would ease the priest shortage have not gained traction with the faith's top leadership.	Abagabo n'abagore bubatse ingo bakomeje kubuzwa kuba abapadiri; Hari ingingo zivuga ko kubuza abo bantu kuba abapadiri bitigeze bituma habaho ibura ry' ubuyobozi bukuru muri kiriziya.
"""What we have is a much smaller number beginning in the 1970s entering seminaries or to convents across the country,"" Gaunt said. ""Those who entered back in the '50s and '60s are now elderly, and so the numbers are determined much more by mortality."""	"Gaunt ati: ""Icyo dufite ni umubare muto cyane guhera mu myaka ya za 70 winjira mu maseminari cyangwa mu makoraniro hirya no hino."" ""Abinjiye mu myaka ya za 50 na 60 ubu barashaje, bigaragazwa n'umubare w'abapfuye."""
From 1970 to 2020, the number of priests in the U.S. dropped by 60%, according to data from the Georgetown center. This has left more than 3,500 parishes without a resident pastor.	Kuva mu 1970 kugeza 2020, umubare w'abapadiri muri Amerika wagabanutseho 60%, nk'uko amakuru ava mu kigo cya Georgetown abitangaza. Ibi byatumye paruwasi zirenga 3.500 zisigara zidafite aba padiri.
Abanulo oversees two parishes in rural Alabama. His typical Sunday starts with an English-language Mass at Holy Family Catholic Church in Lanett, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Birmingham along the Alabama-Georgia state line. After that, he is driven an hour north to Wedowee, where he celebrates one Mass in English, another in Spanish.	Abanulo yayoboraga paruwasi ebyiri zo mu cyaro cya Alabama.  Misa yo kucyumweru ayitangira mu rurimi  rwo mucyongereza kuri kiliziya gatolika ya Holy Family i Lanett, iri nko mu bilometero 200 uvuye i Birmingham   hafi ya Alabama-Jeworujiya. Nyuma yaho, ajyanwa mu majyaruguru yerekeza i Wedowee, aho ayobora Misa imwe yo mu cyongereza, indi mu cyesipanyoli.
"""He just breaks out in song and a lot of his lectures, he ties in his boyhood, and I just love hearing those stories,"" said Amber Moosman, a first-grade teacher who has been a parishioner at Holy Family since 1988."	"Amber Moosman, umwarimu wo mu cyiciro cya mbere wakoreraga muri  paruwasi mu muryango mutagatifu kuva mu 1988, yagize ati: ""Yatangiye akunda  kuririmba kuva mu bwana bwe agakurirana inyigisho,"" nkunda kumva amateka ye"
"For Moosman, Abanulo's preaching style is very different from the priests she's witnessed previously. ""There was no all of a sudden, the priest sings, nothing like that. … It was very quiet, very ceremonial, very strict,"" she said. ""It's a lot different now."""	"Moosman ati"" uburyo bwo kubwiriza bwa Abanulo butandukanye cyane nubw' abapadiri bamubanjirije. Ati: ""Biratangaje cyane kubona umupadiri ukunda kuririmba, ntako bisa. """
Abanulo was ordained in Nigeria in 1990 and came to the U.S. in 2003 after a stint in Chad. His first U.S. role was as an associate pastor in the diocese of Oakland, California, where his ministry focused on the fast-growing Nigerian Catholic community. Since then, he has been a hospital chaplain and pastor in Nashville, Tennessee, and a chaplain at the University of Alabama.	Abanulo yahawe inshingano muri Nijeriya mu 1990 avuye muri Amerika mu 2003 nyuma ajya gukorera muri Tchad. Inshingano yagize bwa mbere muri Amerika ni uko yabaye umushumba wungirije muri diyosezi ya Oakland, muri Californiya, aho ibikorwa bye byibanze ku muryango w'Abagatolika bo muri Nijeriya ugatera imbere. Kuva icyo gihe, yabaye umupadiri w'umwanditsi aba n'umushumba i Nashville, muri Tennesse, akaba n'umupadiri muri kaminuza ya Alabama.
Amid the U.S. clergy shortage, religious sisters have experienced the sharpest declines, dropping 75% since 1970, according to the Georgetown center.	Nk’uko ikigo cya Georgetown kibitangaza  kivuga ko mu gihe abapadiri bo muri Amerika babuze, Aba masera nabo bagabanutse 75% kuva mu 1970.
Culture shocks	Umuco uhungabana
"When Maria Sheri Rukwishuro was told she was being sent from the Sisters of the Infant Jesus order in Zimbabwe to West Virginia to work as a missionary nun, she asked her mother superior, ""Where is West Virginia?"""	"Igihe uwitwa Maria Sheri Rukwishuro yamenyeshwaga  ko yoherejwe kuba umu masera ugiye gufasha abana bato mu gukurikira Yesu muri Zimbabwe ahitwa Virijiniya y’Uburengerazuba ,byari ukugira ngo akore nkumubikira w'umumisiyonari, nuko abaza Umubikira mukuru ati: ""Virginie y'Uburengerazuba iri he?"""
She was scared, worrying about the unknowns.	Yagize ubwoba, ahangayikishwa no kutamenyekana.
"""What kind of people am I going to? I'm just a Black nun coming to a white country,"" Rukwishuro told The Associated Press from Clarksburg, West Virginia, where she has been teaching religious education to public and Catholic school students since arriving in 2004."	"Rukwishuro yatangarije ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abanyamerika avuye i Clarksburg, muri Virijiniya y’Uburengerazuba, aho yigishaga inyigisho z’idini ku banyeshuri bo mu mashuri ya Leta b'aba gatolika kuva yahagera, ati: ""Njya mu bantu bwoko ki? Ndi umubikira w'umwirabura nkaba najya mugihugu cy'abazungu ."" muri 2004."
"Rukwishuro vividly remembers that at her introduction, a little girl walked to her and ""rubbed her finger on my fingers all the way, then she looked at her finger and she smiled but my heart sank. … She thought I was dirty."" Despite that, Rukwishuro says most people have been very welcoming. She's now a U.S. citizen and says, ""It feels like home."""	"Rukwishuro yibuka neza ko agitangira, umukobwa muto yaramwegereye maze amufata urutoki hanyuma abibonye aramwenyura ariko umutima we uradagadwa.… Yatekereje ko nanduye."" Nubwo bimeze bityo, Rukwishuro avuga ko abantu benshi bakiriwe neza. Ubu afite ubwenegihugu bwa Amerika ati: ""Numva ari murugo."""
"One of her first culture shocks was an overnight snowfall. ""I really screamed. I thought it was the end of the world,"" she said. ""Now I love it. I do my meditations to that."""	"Imwe mu mico ye ya mbere yatunguye ni ukurira kwe nijoro. Ati: ""Naramwinginze rwose. Natekerezaga ko isi irangiye"" ""Ubu ntakibazo ariko gihari. Nkora ibyo nshaka."""
During their integration into American life, it is commonplace for newly arrived clergy to face culture shocks.	Mu gihe cyo kwisanisha n'imico y' abanyamerika, birasanzwe ko abapadiri bashya bahageze bahita bisanisha nimico yabo
"For Sister Christiana Onyewuche of Nigeria, a hospital chaplain in Boston administering last rites for the dying, it was cremation. She recalled thinking, ""Like really? … How can they burn somebody? I can't even imagine."""	"Umubikira witwa Christiana Onyewuche wo muri Nijeriya, yabonye umupadiri i Boston ayoboye imihango yo gushyingura, abona bidasanzwe. Atangira kwibaza ati: ibi ni ukuri?… Nigute bashobora gutwika umuntu? ati"" sindi kubyiyumvisha."
She came to the U.S. 18 years ago and previously served as the president of African Conference of Catholic Clergy and Religious, a support group for African missionaries serving in the U.S.	Hashize imyaka 18 ubwo aheruka muri Amerika,  mbere yari perezida w’inama nyafurika y’abayobozi ba kiliziya gatolika n’amadini, itsinda rishyigikira abamisiyoneri bo muri Afurika bakorera muri Amerika
Jesus necks'	Yesu nijosi '
Onyewuche said African clergy can face communication challenges with the Americans they serve. To address this, many dioceses have offered training to soften accents, she said. Abanulo, who went through the training in Oakland, says it helped him slow down his speech and improve his pronunciations.	Onyewuche yavuze ko abanyamadini bo muri Afurika bashobora guhura n'ibibazo by'itumanaho hagati yabo n' Abanyamerika bakorera. Yavuze ko kugira ngo iki kibazo gikemuke, diyosezi nyinshi zatanze amahugurwa ajyanye nuburyo bwo koroshya imvugo. Abanulo wanyuze mu mahugurwa muri Oakland, avuga ko byamufashije kuko yamenye kuvuga neza mu mvugo yoroheje.
Abanulo, who moved to Alabama in 2020, admits he was initially apprehensive about his latest posting, which meant exchanging a comfortable role as university chaplain for two rural parishes.	Abanulo, wimukiye muri Alabama mu 2020, yemera ko yabanje kugira ubwoba ku byo aheruka kohereza, bivuze ko yahinduye inshingano akabona izindi nziza kuko yabaye umuyobozi wa kaminuza kuri paruwasi ebyiri zo mu cyaro.
"""People were telling me 'Father, don't go there. The people there are rednecks,'"" he said."	"Ati: ""Abantu barambwiraga bati 'Data, ntujyeyo. Abantu baho ntago bize ni injiji"
"But after a year, and a warm reception, he says he now tells his friends, ""There are no rednecks here. All I see are Jesus necks."""	"Ariko nyuma y' umwaka, bari bamaze kungirira urugwiro,abwira inshuti ze ati: ""Hano nta njiji zihari. Aba Bose ureba ni intore za Yesu."""
US to Lift Travel Ban on 8 Southern African Countries	Amerika kugirango ikureho ingendo mu bihugu 8 byo muri Afrika yepfo
The U.S. will lift travel restrictions to eight southern African countries on New Year's Eve, the White House announced Friday.	Ku wa gatanu, White House yatangaje ko Amerika izakuraho inzitizi z’ingendo mu bihugu umunani byo muri Afurika yepfo.
The restrictions, imposed last month, were meant to blunt the spread of the COVID omicron variant.	Ibibujijwe, byashyizweho mukwezi gushize, byari bigamije guhagarika ikwirakwizwa rya COVID omicron.
The Nov. 29 ban barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens who had recently been in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi.	Itegeko ryo ku ya 29 Ugushyingo ryarebaga abaturage bose batari Abanyamerika bari baherutse kuba muri Afurika y'Epfo, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibiya, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique na Malawi.
White House spokesman Kevin Munoz said on Twitter that the decision was recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Munoz said the temporary travel bans bought scientists necessary time to study the new virus variant and conclude that the current vaccinations are effective in blunting its impact.	Umuvugizi wa White House, Kevin Munoz, kuri Twitter yavuze ko iki cyemezo cyasabwe n'ikigo gishinzwe kurwanya no gukumira ibiza,  Munoz yavuze ko guhagarika ingendo by'agateganyo byasuzumwe  n'abahanga  muburyo bwo kubona igihe gihagije cyo gusuzima ubwoko bushya bwa virusi. Maze  asoza avuga ko inkingo ziriho ubu zifite akamaro mu guhosha ingaruka zatewe n'icyorezo.
Omicron is now spreading rapidly throughout the U.S., including among the vaccinated, but a huge majority of those being hospitalized are unvaccinated.	Ubu Omicron iri gukwirakwira hose muri Amerika, harimo no mu bakingiwe, ariko umubare munini w'abari mu bitaro ni abatarakingiwe.
"""The restrictions gave us time to understand Omicron and we know our existing vaccines work against Omicron, esp boosted,"" Munoz wrote on Twitter."	"Munoz yanditse kuri Twitter ati: ""Amabwiriza yaduhaye umwanya wo gusobanukirwa Omicron kandi tuzi ko inkingo zacu zisanzwe zirwanya Omicron,harimo nurwo gushimangira""."
Charting the Future of China’s Infrastructure Projects in Africa After a Decade of Lending	Ishusho  y'ejo hazaza y' ibikorwa  Remezo by'Ubushinwa muri Afurika Nyuma y'Imyaka icumi bariyo.
China is financing the construction of four coal-fired power plants in southern Africa, despite its climate pledge in September to quit supporting such infrastructure overseas. But the new facilities taking shape in South Africa and Zimbabwe are just a few of Beijings massive investments in airports, railway lines and other national infrastructure on the African continent.

"China committed to lending African countries $153 billion from 2000-2019, but that pace of lending may be slowing down. Chinese loan commitments dropped by 30% in 2019 when compared with the previous year, according to the China-Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.

In Zambia for example, Chinese financiers committed $10.3 billion in loans from 2000-2010.Since 2000, Zambia has only repaid some $1.2 billion to Chinese lenders.

"U.S. and British officials say, ""debt traps,"" where countries cannot raise enough money to repay Chinas loans, are structured to give Beijing leverage over time. Last month, the head of Britains Secret Intelligence Service, Richard Moore, in an interview with BBC Radio 4 said Beijing can acquire ""significant ports which have the potential to become naval facilities etcetera."""

"""Not a single project in Africa has ever been ""confiscated"" by China because of failing to pay Chinese loans.

"Ati: ""Nta mushinga n'umwe muri Afurika wigeze "" ufashwa"" n'Ubushinwa kubera ko Afurika itishyuye inguzanyo z'Abashinwa.

Instead of seizing assets, Beijing will likely extend deadlines for loan repayment or rework payback terms such as interest rates, analysts told VOA. Those measures would avert takeovers of the infrastructure itself and in turn preserve Chinas reputation in Africa where trade and lending have bested its superpower rival in dollar terms.	Aho gufatira imitungo, Beijing irashobora kongera igihe ntarengwa cyo kwishyura inguzanyo cyangwa kongera gusubiramo bundi bushya amabwiriza yo kwishyura nk'inyungu, nkuko abasesenguzi babitangarije VOA.

Chinese loan concerns	Ibyerekeranye n' inguzanyo y'Ubushinwa
"China encourages lending to Africa in search of high returns on investments and a global reputation as a supporter of poor countries, said Edward Miguel, Oxfam professor in Environmental Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. It is trying to ""equal the U.S."" as a donor country, he said."	"Ubushinwa bushishikariza Afurika mu gufata inguzanyo ku nyungu nyinshi no mubijyanye n' ishoramari ndetse no ku isi hose murwego rwo gushyigikira ibihugu bikennye, nk'uko byatangajwe na Edward Miguel, umwarimu wa Oxfam mu bijyanye n'ubukungu bushingiye ku bidukikije muri kaminuza ya Californiya, Berkeley yavuze ko  Ubushinwa buri kugerageza kumera kimwe na Amerika"" nk'igihugu cy'abaterankunga."
However, China differs from other international lenders and donors mainly for its relative lack of transparency that raises questions in Africa as well as in the West, Miguel believes.	Miguel yemeza ko ariko, Ubushinwa butandukanye n’abandi batanga inguzanyo n’abaterankunga kubera ahanini kuba butagaragaza umucyo mubijyanye n'inguzanyo, ibyo bitera Afurika kwibaza ibibazo ndetse no mu Burengerazuba.
"Unlike loans from western governments or international lending bodies like the World Bank, which require labor and environmental safeguards on financed projects, Chinas aid and loans to Africa have been described as ""no strings attached,"" which has been attractive for many countries. But African nations, especially with economies slipping because of the impacts of COVID-19, face increasing trouble paying back loans, said Hannah Ryder, senior associate with the Africa Program at the U.S. think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies."	Bitandukanye n’inguzanyo zitangwa na guverinoma y’iburengerazuba cyangwa imiryango mpuzamahanga itanga inguzanyo nka Banki y’isi, kuko yo isaba imishinga  ijyanye no kubungabunga ibidukikije kugira ngo iterwe inkunga, inahabwe imfashanyo n’Abashinwa. Inguzanyo muri Afurika zasobanuwe  nta bufatanye bushimishije mu bihugu byinshi buhari Ariko ibihugu by'Afurika, cyane cyane ko ubukungu bwifashe nabi kubera ingaruka za COVID-19, ibyo bikiyongera ku kibazo cyo kwishyura inguzanyo nk'uko Hannah Ryder, umufatanyabikorwa mu kuru muri gahunda ya Afurika mu kigo gishinzwe iby'imitekerereze cya Amerika gishinzwe gufata ingamba n’ubushakashatsi mpuzamahanga yabitangaje.
"""China and other countries are becoming more sophisticated in bargaining with one another,"" wrote Deborah Brautigam of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and Harvard Business School's Meg Rithmire in a joint article."	"Mu kiganiro bahuriyemo, Deborah Brautigam wo mu Ishuri Rikuru ry’Ubushakashatsi Mpuzamahanga muri kaminuza ya Johns Hopkins na Meg Rithmire w’ishuri ry’ubucuruzi rya Harvard, yanditse ati: ""Ubushinwa n’ibindi bihugu biri kurushaho kugirana ubwumvikane"""
Residents in Dakar, Senegal, where the 500-person Forum on China-Africa Cooperation meeting took place on November 29-30, want more Chinese-funded infrastructure but without debt levels like those of the 1990s, Ryder noted.	Ryder yavuze ko ubwo habaga inama yabatuye i Dakar, muri Senegali, ihuriro ry’abantu 500 ry’inama y'ubufatanye bw’Ubushinwa na Afurika yabaye ku ya 29-30 Ugushyingo, bifuzaga ko ibikorwa remezo byaterwa inkunga n’abashinwa ariko nta nguzanyo batse nkiyo mu myaka ya za 90.
"Chinese creditors are expected to lend less money to Africa going forward and more carefully analyze the projects those loans support, experts say. Loans have already ""sobered down"" [tapered off] from a peak in 2014, Jili said."	"Impuguke zivuga ko Abashoramari b'Abashinwa bateganya gutanga amafaranga make muri Afurika kandi bagasesengura neza imishinga izo nguzanyo ziza gushyigikira. Jili yavuze ko inguzanyo zimaze ""kugabanuka"" kuva muri 2014."
Commitments for loans and other investments made at the China-Africa Cooperation meeting came to $40 billion, one-third less than the $60 billion made at the same conference in 2018.	Ingamba zafashwe mu gutanga inguzanyo mu ishoramari, zafatiwe mu nama y’ubufatanye bw’Ubushinwa na Afurika, bemeje ko izamanuka kugeza kuri miliyari 40 z'amadolari, hanyuma miliyari 60 z'amadolari yo akaba yaratanzwe mu nama  yo mu 2018.
Lenders may calibrate loans based on predictions of a post-pandemic future when African countries have more cash, said Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia program at the Stimson Center in Washington. Another option, she said, is to ensure Chinese equity from future projects as repayment for older loans, she said in a VOA interview.	Yun Sun, umuyobozi wa gahunda ya Aziya y'Uburasirazuba mu kigo cya Stimson i Washington, yatangaje ko abatanga inguzanyo bashobora guhitamo inguzanyo zishingiye ku kureba uko bizagenda nyuma y'icyorezo mu gihe ibihugu by'Afurika bifite amafaranga menshi. Mu kiganiro VOA yavuze ko ubundi buryo bushoboka , ari ukureba niba Ubushinwa buzatanga amahirwe angana kubihugu mu minsi iri imbere mu kwishyura inguzanyo za kera
"""Its politically risky, because although its not an equity-asset swap, it smells a lot like some sort of swap, and [that] China is exploiting Africas weak position, so I dont think it will happen in the immediate future and in fact this debt restructuring is also taking quite a while,"" Sun said."	sun yagize ati:''Iki ni ikibazo cya politiki gishobora guteza akaga, kubera ko kutanganya imitungo bimeze nkaho ari  byiza ariko kandi Ubushinwa buca intege Afurika , ku buryo ntekereza ko bizabaho mu gihe cya vuba kandi mu byukuri uku kuvugurura imyenda nabyo bifata igihe kitari gito.
"China is becoming more confident all the while in setting up international public-private partnerships, though many African countries still worry about a repeat of the debt crisis in the 1980s and 1990s when nations could not pay off debt, Ryder says in an African Business commentary. International organizations ultimately wrote off that wave of unaffordable debt with conditions including opening ""their economies to international trade, liberalize their currencies and drastically cut costs in exchange for loans,"" wrote Peter Fabricius in the Institute for Security Studies."	"Ryder avuga ko Ubushinwa bugenda bugira icyizere mu mikoranire mpuzamahanga ya Leta n’abikorera ku giti cyabo, nubwo ibihugu byinshi bya Afurika bikomeje guhangayikishwa n' ikibazo cy’imyenda yo mu myaka ya za 1980 na 1990 igihe ibihugu bitashoboye kwishyura imyenda, nk'uko Ryder abitangaza. . Peter Fabricius mu kigo cy’ubushakashatsi mubijyanye n'umutekano yaranditse ati: ""Imiryango mpuzamahanga yamaze gusonera imyenda itakibasha kwishyurwa, harimo iy'ibiribwa, ubukungu bwabo muby' ubucuruzi mpuzamahanga, kwishyira ukizana kwabo no kugabanya amafaranga menshi kugira ngo bahabwe inguzanyo ""."
"Fast forward to the present, with loans from China, African countries, Miguel said, often end up asking ""what did we agree to do"" and ""how much do we owe"" China."	Miguel yavuze ko kugeza ubu byihuta cyane,  inguzanyo zituruka mu Bushinwa,zijya mu bihugu bya Afurika, akenshi zikurikirwa no kubaza icyo abanyafurika bazazikoresha, ndetse no kubaza ngo ni abantu bangahe zigenewe ngo bazazikoreshe?
Dutch Test for New Variant After Finding 61 COVID Cases Among South Africa Passengers	Ubu Buholandi bufite ibipimo by a Covid Nyuma yo Kubona abantu  61 banduye  Covid 19 b'abagenzi  muri Afrika yepfo
Dutch health authorities said Saturday they had detected 61 COVID-19 cases among people who flew Friday from South Africa and were now doing further tests to see whether any are infected with the new omicron variant.	Inzego z’ubuzima z’Ubuholandi zavuze ko ku wa gatandatu zabonye abantu 61 COVID-19 mu bantu bahagurutse ku wa gatanu bava muri Afurika yepfo none bakaba barimo gukora ibindi bizamini kugira ngo barebe niba hari abanduye icyorezo  kihinduranya gishya.
The cases were discovered among around 600 passengers who arrived at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on two flights Friday before the Dutch government halted air traffic from southern Africa due to concerns over the variant.	Abagaragawe ho n'ubwandu ni mu bagenzi bagera kuri 600 bageze ku kibuga cy’indege cya Schiphol cya Amsterdam mu ndege ebyiri ku wa gatanu mbere yuko guverinoma y’Ubuholandi ihagarika ingendo z’indege ziva muri Afurika yepfo kubera impungenge zatewe n'icyorezo kihinduranya.
Dutch health authorities said Saturday they also would seek to contact travelers who had arrived from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe since Monday and urge them to take a test as soon as possible.	Inzego z’ubuzima z’Ubuholandi zavuze ko ku wa Gatandatu nazo zishaka kuvugana n’abagenzi bari baturutse muri Afurika yepfo, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia na Zimbabwe kuva ku wa mbere kandi bakazabasaba kwipimisha vuba bishoboka.
The passengers from Friday's flights were kept separated from other travelers and those who tested positive are being kept in isolation at a hotel near the airport.	Abagenzi bavuye mu ndege ku wa Gatanu bipimishije bashyizwe mu kato muri hoteri iri hafi y'ikibuga cy’indege.
A spokesperson for the health ministry said it would not be known until later Saturday whether any of passengers are infected with the new variant.	Umuvugizi muri minisiteri y’ubuzima yavuze ko bitaramenyekana niba  hari abagenzi banduye iyo variant nshya kugeza kuwa Gatandatu
A spokesperson for KLM, the Dutch arm of Air France, said the airline was trying to determine what rules were in place as of Friday morning to prevent people with COVID-19 infections from boarding the flights, which departed from Cape Town and Johannesburg.	Umuvugizi wa KLM, wo mu ishami ry'abashinzwe ingendo z'indege mu buholandi, yavuze ko indege zigerageza kubahiriza amategeko yashyizweho mu gitondo cyo kuri uyu wa Gatanu kugira ngo abantu banduye COVID-19 batinjira mu ndege  zaturutse i Cape Town na Johannesburg.
"Rules on the company's website said passengers had to present a negative COVID-19 ""rapid antigen"" test result taken 24 hours before departure but were not required to show proof of vaccination."	Kurubuga  rw'itumanaho rw’isosiye  batangaje ko abagenzi bagombaga kwerekana ibisubizo bya COVID-19 byafashwe mbere y'amasaha 24 mbere yo kugenda ariko si ngombwa kwerekana ibyangombwa byuko bakingiwe.
Really Weird' Paula Zimmerman, a Dutch photographer who returned from a family visit in South Africa on Friday morning, said the situation for the passengers on the planes was chaotic, as they were kept waiting on the tarmac and in the terminal for hours.	Mu byukuri Weird 'Paula Zimmerman, umufotozi mu buholandi ubwo yagarukaga avuye gusura umuryango we muri Afurika yepfo mu gitondo cyo kuri uyu wa Gatanu, yavuze ko ikibazo cy’abagenzi mu ndege cyari akajagari, kuko bakomeje gutegereza kuri gari ya moshi kugeza amasaha yari ateganijwe arangiye.
Zimmerman was told she had tested negative at 4 a.m., almost 18 hours after landing in Amsterdam, but said she then found out she was standing right next to a man who knew he had tested positive for an infection.	Zimmerman yavuze ko yipimishije saa yine za mugitondo agasanga atanduye icyorezo, nyuma y'amasaha 18 nyuma yo guhaguruka n'indege kuri Amsterdam, yavuzeko yahise amenya ko yicaye  iruhande rw'umugabo wari wanduye icyorezo .
"""It was really weird."	Abantu bagombaga kugira amakenga
There was no coordination.	Ntagahunda ihamye  yari ihari.
"There were too few people and there really wasnt anybody who took control."" Having spent hours on a flight that likely had many infected passengers made Zimmerman anxious for the days to come, she said. ""Ive been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days."	"Hari yo abantu  bake cyane kandi mu by'ukuri ntabugenzuzi bwari buhari""Ati:"" Ibaze kumara amasaha menshi mu ndege kandi bishoboka ko hari abagenzi benshi banduye ! Ibyo byatumye Zimmerman ahangayika bikomeye dore ko yari amaze kubwirwa ko  bazipimisha nyuma y'iminsi itanu."
"It's a little scary the idea that you've been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive."""	"Byari biteye ubwoba kubona mu ndege umuntu yicaranye n'abantu benshi banduye """
The Dutch flight ban does not mean that all flights from southern Africa to the Netherlands are halted, as Dutch citizens are allowed to return home, while EU citizens are allowed entry in transit to their home countries.	Guhagarika indege y’Ubuholandi ntibisobanura ko ingendo zose ziva muri Afurika yepfo zerekeza mu Buholandi zahagaritswe, kubera ko abaturage b’Ubuholandi bemerewe gusubira mu rugo, mu gihe abanyaburayi bemerewe kujya mu bihugu byabo.
Medical staff, airline crews and people with pressing needs are also still allowed to travel. KLM will continue flights to the region, but travelers need to stay in quarantine for at least five days upon arrival in the Netherlands.	Abakozi bo mu buvuzi, abakozi b'indege hamwe n' abantu bafite ibibazo byingutu nabo baracyemerewe gukora ingendo. KLM izakomeza ingendo zerekeza mu karere, ariko abagenzi bazajya bashyirwa mu kato byibura iminsi itanu bakigera mu buholandi.
The new variant has been detected just as many European countries are grappling with a surge in coronavirus cases.	Icyorezo gishya kihinduranya cyamenyekanye nkuko ibihugu byinshi byu Burayi bigenda bihura n’ubwiyongere bwa coronavirus.
The Dutch government on Friday announced the nighttime closure of bars, restaurants and most stores as it tries to curb a record-breaking wave of COVID-19 cases that is swamping its health care system.	Ku wa Gatanu, guverinoma y’Ubuholandi yatangaje ko amasaha ya nijoro, amaresitora n’amaduka menshi  bizaba bifunze mu rwego rwo gukumira ubwandu  bwa COVID-19 kwangiza ubuzima bw'abantu.

Zimbabwe Environmentalists Demand More Than Rhetoric on Climate Change	Abashinzwe ibidukikije muri Zimbabwe Barasaba ko hagira igikorwa kuruta amagambo kubijyanye  n' Imihindagurikire y'Ibihe
Environmentalists in Zimbabwe are reacting angrily to President Emmerson Mnangagwa's address at the COP26 conference, where he pledged his government's fight against deforestation and climate change. Environmentalists say the government is busy dishing out land to companies, mainly Chinese, to mine coal for energy use, which COP26 wants phased out.	Abashinzwe ibidukikije muri Zimbabwe bababajwe cyane  n' ijambo rya Perezida Emmerson Mnangagwa yavugiye  mu nama ya COP26, aho yemeje ko guverinoma ye izarwanya itemwa ry'amashyamba n’imihindagurikire y’ikirere. Abashinzwe ibidukikije bavuga ko guverinoma ihugiye mubyo guhinga ubutaka ku masosiyete, cyane cyane Abashinwa, gucukura amakara yifashishwa mu gucanwa,ariko  COP26 ikifuza ko  byakurwaho.
Tuesday in Scotland, President Emmerson Mnangagwa addressed the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, where he urged developed countries to pay for causing global warming by emitting gases into the atmosphere.	Ku wa kabiri, muri otcosse, Perezida Emmerson Mnangagwa yagejeje ijambo ku nama y’umuryango w’abibumbye ku mihindagurikire y’ibihe mu 2021, izwi ku izina rya COP26, aho yasabye ibihugu byateye imbere gucibwa a amafaranga kubera kohereza imyuka mu kirere.
He said developing nations like Zimbabwe were paying for the consequences of those emissions.	Yavuze ko ibihugu biri mu nzira y'amajyambere nka Zimbabwe byishyura ibyangijwe n'ingaruka z’ibyo byuka.
He also pledged his countrys cooperation in the fight against climate change.	Yijeje kandi ibihugu bye ubufatanye mu kurwanya imihindagurikire y’ikirere.
"""Zimbabwe has revised its nationally determined contributions, a committed conditional 40% per capita greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2030. Comprehensive strategies are being implemented towards mainstreaming climate change adaptation and resilience across all sectors of our economy,"" Mnangagwa said."	"Mnangagwa yagize ati: ""Zimbabwe yavuguruye imisanzu yagenwe ku rwego rw'igihugu, yiyemeje igabanuka ry' imyuka ihumanya ikirere ku kigero cya 40% buri mwaka."
This comes at a time when environmentalists in Zimbabwe are asking the government to revoke an exploration license recently awarded to a Chinese company to mine coal for energy use.	Ibi bibaye mu gihe abashinzwe ibidukikije muri Zimbabwe basaba guverinoma kwambura uruhushya rwo gukora ubushakashatsi ruherutse guhabwa isosiyete y'Abashinwa yo gutunganya ingufu zikomoka ku makara
The Center for Natural Resource Governance is one of the organizations opposing the license. The group promotes green energy, and fears that exploration for coal will cause greater deforestation.

Henry Nyapokoto, the program manager for the group, said Mnangagwas comments run contrary to what he sees going on.	Umuyobozi wa porogaramu muri iryo tsinda, Henry Nyapokoto, yavuze ko ibitekerezo bya Mnangagwas binyuranye n'uko we abona byagenda.
"""But the government has been in overdrive mode to promote mining everywhere in order to reach the $12 billion mining economy. In fact, it wont (make) ecological sense for Zimbabwe to attain a $12 billion economy based on bad models of production, bad consumption, that leaves a huge ecological footprint or a legacy of an ecological disaster. We all understand that mining comes with destruction of forests that serves as carbon sinks and habitat for wildlife,"" Nyapokoto said."	"Ariko guverinoma iri gukora ibishoboka byose ku iterambere mu bucukuzi bw'amabuye y'agaciro ahantu hose hagamijwe ku kongera ubukungu bukagera kuri miliyari 12 z'amadolari.

Nyapokoto added that Zimbabwe was exploring oil and gas on its northeast border with Zambia, another project that could lead to deforestation.	Nyapokoto yongeyeho ko Zimbabwe irimo gushakisha peteroli na gaze ku mupaka w’amajyaruguru na Zambiya, hari nundi mushinga wo gutera andi mashyamba.
"""Despite the impact of oil and gas on global warming, there will be (a) visible, immediate direct effect of this oil and gas mining on local communities or ecosystems. Land will be cleared for mining and other infrastructure that is going to support that mining. That is contrary to the greening of the economy that they are talking about in Glasgow,"" Nyapokoto said."	Peteroli na gaze bigira ingaruka ku bushyuhe bw’isi, harimo  (a) ingaruka zitaziguye ziva muri ubwo bucukuzi bwa peteroli na gaze ku baturage cyangwa ibidukikije.

He said Zimbabwe was in the top 10 of countries of deforestation, with about 300,000 hectares of forests destroyed annually.	Yavuze ko Zimbabwe iri mu bihugu 10 bya mbere bifite amashyamba,ikaba ifite  hegitari 300.000 z’amashyamba zangirika buri mwaka.
But Byron Zamasiya of the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association says Mnangagwa was genuine in his COP26 address about fighting deforestation caused by need for energy.	Ariko Byron Zamasiya wo mu ishyirahamwe ryita ku bidukikije muri Zimbabwe avuga ko Mnangagwa yari umunyakuri mu buyobozi bwe muri  COP26 mu kurwanya itemwa ry' amashyamba yatewe ngo bayakoremo ibicanwa.
"""So, the issue of fighting deforestation is a key ingredient for addressing greenhouse gas emissions for Zimbabwe. The trees act as a carbon sink since they absorb carbon dioxide, which is a major cause of global warming. What we may want as a country is to make available alternative sources of energy, especially for the rural communities who rely on wood fuel and account for the major part of deforestation. We may also need to promote intensive farming methods as opposed to extensive farming methods that require bigger fields and the clearing of new forests for fields,"" Zamasiya said."

Inzobere mu buzima rusange zishimiye iki gikorwa.
Zimbabwes acting Health and Child Care Minister Amon Murwira told journalists late Monday that the country had so far managed to vaccinate 38% of the population.	Minisitiri w’ubuzima no kwita  ku bana ba Zimbabwes, Amon Murwira aherutse kubwira abanyamakuru ku wa mbere ko iki gihugu kugeza ubu cyashoboye gukingira abaturage 38%.
He then announced the recommendation regarding those over the age of 16.	Yahise atangaza ko hagiye gukingirwa  abarengeje imyaka 16.
"""Based on the available scientific data in line with the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe guide, the specialist pediatricians have recommended a vaccination of the 16 to 17 years age group with the Sinovac COVID19 vaccine,"" said Murwira."	"Murwira yagize ati: ""Hashingiwe ku mibare igaragazwa n'ubushakashatsi mu bya siyansi ibyerekana kukijyanye n’ubuyobozi bushinzwe kugenzura imiti ya Zimbabwe, inzobere mu kuvura indwara z’abana basabye ko hatangwa urukingo rw’abafite imyaka 16 kugeza kuri 17 hamwe n’urukingo rwa Sinovac COVID19""."
"""The protocol of the younger age groups is still under consideration. The ministry wishes to advise the public that COVID19 vaccination of the 16 to 17 years age groups has been approved. The government of Zimbabwe through the Ministry of Health and Childcare is determined that Zimbabwe achieves herd immunity by end December 2021,"" he added."	Haracyasuzumwa niba hakingirwa abakiri bato. Minisiteri irashaka kugira inama abaturage ko urukingo rwa COVID19 rugenewe ab’imyaka 16 kugeza kuri 17 rwemejwe. Guverinoma ya Zimbabwe ibinyujije muri Minisiteri y’ubuzima n’ubuvuzi y’abana yemeje ko Zimbabwe amatungo yaho azaba afite ubudahangarwa mu mpera z'Ukuboza 2021 .

"""This is a welcome move, but we just hope that the vaccine will continue to be voluntary and that these teenagers will not be mandated to get vaccines in schools and colleges. But people should just continue to voluntarily get the vaccines,"" he said."	"Ati: ""Iyi ni intambwe ishimishije, ariko turizera gusa ko urukingo ruzakomeza gufatwaku bushake kandi ko ingimbi zifite uburenganzira bwo kubona inkingo mu mashuri makuru na za kaminuza. Ariko abantu bagomba gukomeza gukingirwa kubushake bwabo""."
Itai Rusike, head of nonprofit Community Working Group on Health in Zimbabwe, commended the government for the announcement as it helps the country reach its target of vaccinating at least 10 million Zimbabweans — or 60% of the population — by the end of the year.	Itai Rusike, umuyobozi w’itsinda ridaharanira inyungu n'ubuzima muri Zimbabwe, yashimye guverinoma ko yafashije igihugu kugera ku ntego yo gukingira byibuze miliyoni 10 z’Abanyazimbabwe - cyangwa 60% by’abaturage - mu mpera z’umwaka.
"""This is important in order to prevent the teenagers from COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and even death, especially from the looming threat of the new delta variant. It is also important that the school health coordinators are equipped with the necessary COVID-19 vaccine literacy so that they can then assist in educating the students, the teachers and support staff on the importance of getting vaccinated. It is also important that the community leaders should play a critical role in being our COVID-19 champions and ambassadors so that they can encourage the parents and the children within their communities to embrace the vaccines,"" said Rusike."

Zimbabwe President Mnangagwa to Attend COP26 Conference	Perezida wa Zimbabwe Mnangagwa yitabiriye  Inama ya COP26
Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa says he will attend COP26, becoming the first Zimbabwe leader to visit the United Kingdom since Zimbabwe was accused of human rights abuses and election rigging. Mnangagwa also said a U.N. rapporteur had proved his government was right about the sanctions issue.

Natumiwe na [Minisitiri w’intebe w’Ubwongereza] Boris Johnson, na  kimwe n'abandi bayobozi nka minisitiri w’intebe w’Ubuhinde n’abandi, turahura nabo.
Mnangagwa also said he was happy about a report by U.N. Special Rapporteur Alena Douhan after a two-week visit to Zimbabwe. The Belarus national urged the U.S. and other Western governments to lift sanctions they imposed on Zimbabwe nearly two decades ago and for alleged election-rigging and human rights abuses.	Mnangagwa yavuze kandi ko yishimiye raporo yakozwe n'Umunyamabanga wihariye wa Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika Alena Douhan muri ibi byumweru bibiri muri Zimbabwe.

"""We as government, we as ZANU-PF, have been vindicated by the report released by the United Nations special rapporteur. We should congratulate ourselves.

Twe nka guverinoma, mu ishyaka ryacu ZANU-PF, twarengewe na raporo yashyizwe ahagaragara n'umunyamabanga wihariye w'Umuryango w'Abibumbye. Tugomba kubyishimira. Ntabwo twigeze twibeshya,Munnanganwa aravuga kandi ko azakomeza guhora turangwa n'ukuri.
But in an audio statement released by the U.S. Embassy in Harare, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said sanctions on Zimbabwes leadership were not hurting ordinary citizens.	Ariko mu byashyizwe ahagaragara  na Ambasade y’Amerika i Harare, Ambasaderi w’Amerika mu Muryango w’abibumbye Linda Thomas-Greenfield yavuze ko ibihano byahawe abayobozi ba Zimbabwe bitababaje gusa abaturage basanzwe.
"""Our sanctions target individuals and institutions that are committing human rights violations. And we make every effort to ensure those sanctions do not impact the people. What is happening in Zimbabwe is a result of bad policies in Zimbabwe. What is happening in Zimbabwe is a consequence of their leadership. It is not a consequence of our sanctions, and we will always resist any criticism that says our sanctions are impacting people unfairly. We are criticized by the government [of Zimbabwe] for these actions because they know they are responsible for these actions. I regret that the special rapporteur decided to put this in [her] report,"" Thomas-Greenfield said."	Ibihano byacu byibanda ku bantu no ku bigo birimo guhonyora uburenganzira bwa muntu.

Turanengwa na guverinoma [ya Zimbabwe] kubera ibyo bikorwa kuko bazi ko ari bo babishinzwe. Ndicuza kuba umunyamakuru wihariye yahisemo kubitangaza muri raporo ye , Thomas-Greenfield.
The European Union imposed travel and financial sanctions on then-Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe and his allies in 2002, in response to reports of election-rigging and human rights. The U.S. followed suit with sanctions in 2003.	Umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’iburayi wahaye ibihano perezida wa Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe na bagenzi be, harimo guhagarika ingendo no gucibwa amafaranga mu 2002, hagarutswe ku makuru yavuga ko uburiganya bw’amatora n’uburenganzira bwa muntu. Amerika yabashyiriyeho ibihano mu 2003.
Earlier this week, in separate statements, the U.S., Britain and the European Union said Zimbabwes economy was suffering, not because of sanctions but because of corruption and government mismanagement of the countrys resources.

"""Its not a crime to demonstrate in Zimbabwe, its not a crime to petition. Its actually provided for by the constitution,"" Saurombe said. ""So in anything that has to be done, it has to be done in those ambits of the constitution or in those constitutional provisions. And our clients were following constitutional provisions, so to say they committed a crime it would rather be absurd."""	"Saurombe ati: ""Ntabwo ari icyaha kwigaragambya muri Zimbabwe, ntabwo gusaba icyo ushaka ari icyaha mu by'ukuri giteganywa n'itegeko nshinga.""

"The veterans are expected to go on trial next month. The offense of ""breaching the peace,"" which they face, has an option of a fine if they are convicted."	"Biteganijwe ko abahoze mu rugerero bazaburanishwa ukwezi gutaha. Icyaha cyo ""guhungabanya amahoro,"" bakazacibwaihazabu  nibaramuka bahamwe n'icyaha."

"""Various initiatives have been implemented to improve the dignity, welfare and economic empowerment of veterans of the liberation struggle and dependence of the heroes,"" Mnangagwa said. ""But I urge the war veterans to use procedures in the party, not outside the party.Their rich ideological grounding should galvanize the principle of patriotism in the hearts and minds of cadres and embolden them in their efforts to ensure that ZANU-PF remains the party of choice which wholeheartedly serves the people."""	"Mnangagwa ati: ""Hashyizweho ingamba zinyuranye zo kuzamura icyubahiro, imibereho myiza no kongerera ubushobozi ubukungu bw'abahoze ku rugamba rwo kwibohora.""

Zimbabwe Government: No COVID-19 Shot, No Work, No Pay	"Guverinoma ya Zimbabwe iragira iti"" Kubera COVID-19 , Nta kazi, nta n' umushahara"
Union leaders have angrily reacted to the Zimbabwean governments announcement Sunday that workers who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 will no longer be allowed at work and will not be paid. This is seen as part of efforts to deal with high vaccination hesitancy in the southern African nation. .

"""Fundamentally, there was no agreement over the issue of vaccination,"" said Takavafira Zhou, president of Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe. ""Our position as workers has always remained that we encourage our members to be vaccinated. But by no means should our encouragement be misconstrued for mandatory vaccination. Our position is very clear: vaccination must be voluntary. Not mandatory. We must invest in the efficacy of vaccination — explaining to members how vaccination would assist them in terms of boosting their immunity but that has not been done."""

""Following an escalation in the New Zealand Government threat levels for Pakistan, and advice from NZC security advisers on the ground, it has been decided the BLACKCAPS will not continue with the tour,"" a press statement from the New Zealand cricket team said."	"Ikipe ya Cricket ya Nouvelle-Zélande yatangaje ko ihagaritse ingendo zayo muri Pakisitani kuri uyu wa Gatatu kubera impungenge z'umutekano , hari hateganijwe umukino Wa mbere. Itangazo rigenewe abanyamakuru ry’ikipe ya Cricket ya Nouvelle-Zélande ryagize riti: ""Nyuma y’uko muri Leta ya Nouvelle-Zélande Pakisitani, hagaragaye umutekano muke,abajyanama b’umutekano ba NZC , bemeje ko BLACKCAPS isubitse  urugendo."""
"Pakistani officials reacted strongly, calling the decision ""unilateral"" and a conspiracy against Pakistans image. ""None of our various intelligence agencies had received any indication of a security threat,"" said Pakistans Interior Minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed. He added that Pakistan had offered to hold the matches without spectators, but the offer was rejected. Pakistani Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Ali Haider Zaidi said he was ""appalled"" at the decision. ""Sadly, global politics has won over the great game of cricket! There were no security threats! @jacindaardern,"" he said, tagging the New Zealand prime minister in his tweet."	"Abayobozi ba Pakisitani babyakiriye neza, bavuga ko iki cyemezo ""ari ntamakemwa"" kandi ko ari uburyo bwiza bugaragaza isura nziza y'Abanyapakistani. Minisitiri w’ubutegetsi bw’igihugu cya Pakisitani, Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed yagize ati: ""Nta nzego z’ubutasi zigeze zigaragaza ko hari ikintu gihungabanya umutekano."" Yongeyeho ko Pakisitani yemeye gukina imikino ntabafana bahari ariko bakayangira. Minisitiri w’ibikorwa by’amazi muri Pakisitani, Ali Haider Zaidi, yatangaje ko yatangajwe n’iki cyemezo. Ati: ""Ikibabaje ni uko hari  abanyapolitike ku isi batsinze umukino ukomeye wa Cricket! Nta kibazo cy'umutekano cyari gihari! @Jacindaardern""."
"Prime Minister Imran Khan personally called Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to guarantee the teams safety, but she stood by her teams decision, according to Ahmed and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). The PCB said it had arranged ""fool proof security"" for the visiting team and New Zealand security officials had been satisfied with their arrangements. ""[C]ricket lovers in Pakistan and around the world will be disappointed by this last-minute withdrawal,"" the board said. The chief executive of the Black Caps, David White, said he could not ignore the advice he was receiving. ""I understand this will be a blow for the PCB, who have been wonderful hosts, but player safety is paramount, and we believe this is the only responsible option,"" he said. The two sides were to play three one-day matches in Rawalpindi, known as the twin city of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, followed by a series of five limited over matches or T-20s in Pakistans second-largest city, Lahore."	"Minisitiri w’intebe Imran Khan yahamagaye Minisitiri w’intebe Jacinda Ardern kugira ngo amwizeze umutekano w’amakipe, ahagarara kucyemezo cyafashwe kubijyanye n' amakipe ye, nkuko byatangajwe na Ahmed hamwe n’ikigo gishinzwe imikino cya Pakisitani (PCB). PCB yavuze ko yacunze umutekano  bitari ngombwa kuruhande rw' itsinda ryabasuye kandi abashinzwe umutekano muri Nouvelle-Zélande uburyo  gahunda zabo ziteguye zirahagije. Ubuyobozi bwagize buti: ""Abakunzi ba rike muri Pakisitani ndetse no ku isi yose bazababazwa nuko umukino uzarangira."" Umuyobozi mukuru wa Black Caps, David White, yavuze ko adashobora kwirengagiza inama yahawe. Ati: ""Numva ko ibi kuri PCB bizaba ari byiza, ariko umutekano w'abakinnyi nicyo cya mbere, kandi twizera ko iyi ari yo nzira yonyine ikwiye"". Impande zombi zagombaga gukina imikino itatu umunsi umwe i Rawalpindi, ahazwi  nk'umujyi umeze kimwe nk' umurwa mukuru wa Pakisitani, Islamabad, hagakurikiraho indi mikino itatu ikurikiranye T-20s mu mujyi wa kabiri munini wa Pakisitani, Lahore."
"The chief executive of the PCB, Wasim Khan, told VOA the New Zealand team would head home Saturday on a chartered plane. An English cricket team was scheduled to visit Pakistan in October, but Interior Minister Ahmed said that tour also was now in doubt. ""Ministry of Interior has informed me that the English team is also thinking along the same lines. On our part, we are ready to welcome them. There is no security threat in our country to either New Zealand or England,"" he said. International cricket teams stopped visiting Pakistan after an attack on a Sri Lankan cricket team in 2009 in Lahore that wounded seven members of the team. Pakistan went through several years of violence starting approximately in 2007 as extremist groups blaming Pakistan for siding with the United States in its war on terror started attacking both its security forces and civilians. Pakistani officials claim up to 80,000 of their citizens died in these attacks, and the country suffered up to $150 billion worth of damage to its economy. In 2016, Pakistani cricket authorities formed the Pakistan Super League, six cricket teams representing six cities. The teams included international players in an effort to revive international cricket in Pakistan. The first two seasons of the league were played outside Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates. The first international team to return to Pakistan was Zimbabwe in 2015."	"Umuyobozi mukuru wa PCB, Wasim Khan, yabwiye VOA ko ikipe ya Nouvelle-Zélande izerekeza izasubira iwabo ku wa Gatandatu ikodesheje indege.  Biteganijwe ko ikipe y’umukino wa Cricket mu Bwongereza izasura Pakisitani mu Kwakira, ariko Minisitiri w’imbere mu gihugu Ahmed yavuze ko uruzinduko narwo ruteye amakenga. Ati: ""Minisiteri y'Ubutegetsi bw'igihugu yamenyesheje ko ikipe y'Ubwongereza nayo ishaka kuza. Twebwe twiteguye kubakira. Nta kibazo cy'umutekano muke  kiri mu gihugu cyacu haba muri Nouvelle-Zélande cyangwa mu Bwongereza"". Amakipe mpuzamahanga ya Cricket yahagaritse gusura Pakisitani nyuma y’igitero cyagabwe ku ikipe ya Cricket ya Sri Lankan mu 2009 i Lahore hagakomereka abantu barindwi bagize iyi kipe. Pakisitani yakorewe urugomo guhera muntangiro zo mu 2007 ubwo imitwe y’intagondwa yashinjaga Pakisitani kuba yarashyigikiye Amerika mu ntambara yo kurwanya iterabwoba yatangiye kwibasira abashinzwe umutekano ndetse n’abasivili. Abayobozi ba Pakisitani bavuga ko abaturage babo bagera ku 80.000 bapfiriye muri ibyo bitero, kandi igihugu cyahuye ningaruka mbi kubukungu bugabanuka kugera kuri miliyari 150 z'amadolari. Muri 2016, abategetsi ba Cricket muri Pakisitani bashinze Pakistan Super League, amakipe atandatu ya Cricket ahagarariye imigi itandatu. Amakipe yarimo abakinnyi mpuzamahanga mu rwego rwo kubyutsa umupira w'amaguru mpuzamahanga muri Pakisitani. ibyiciro bibiri byambere bya shampiyona byakiniwe hanze ya Pakisitani muri United Arab Emirates.

African Leaders Discuss Ways to Minimize Impact of Climate Change	Abayobozi b'Abanyafurika baganira ku buryo bwo kugabanya ingaruka z’imihindagurikire y’ibihe
High-level African officials met virtually this week to discuss the challenges Africa faces in trying to manage a growing population amid climate change. The conference was aimed at identifying ways African governments can manage these pressures to minimize or avoid conflict.	Muri iki cyumweru abayobozi bo muri Afurika bahuye hafi ya bose kugira ngo baganire ku mbogamizi Afurika ihura nazo mu kugerageza guhangana n’imihindagurikire y’ikirere. Iyi nama yari igamije kumenya uburyo guverinoma z’Afurika zishobora gukemura ibyo bibazo kugira ngo hagabanuke cyangwa birinde amakimbirane.
Africa generates about 3% percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, the lowest of any continent. But its more vulnerable than any other region in the world, since Africans depend so heavily on their natural environment for food, water and medicine.	Afurika yohereza mukirere hafi 3% by'ibyuka bihumanya ikirere ku isi, biri hasi cyane ku mugabane ugereranyije nindi migabane. Ariko irashobora kwibasirwa n’utundi turere twose ku isi, kubera ko Abanyafurika bo bibanda cyane ku bidukikije, ku biribwa, amazi n’imiti.
Speaking at a virtual conference Tuesday on climate, conflict and demographics in Africa, Nigerian Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said African governments need to keep the climate in mind as they try to boost their economies.	Ku wa kabiri, Visi Perezida wa Nijeriya, Yemi Osinbajo, mu nama isanzwe ivuga ku bijyanye n’ikirere, amakimbirane n’imibare muri Afurika, yavuze ko guverinoma z’Afurika zigomba kubungabunga ikirere muburyo bwo kuzamura ubukungu bwazo.
"""Our first obligation for us and for African countries must always be to ensure the well-being of our people through access to development services, including electricity, health care, education, safe jobs and a safe environment, including access to clean cooking fuels. We must prioritize solutions that align the development and climate agenda, and that is absolutely important,"" said Osinbajo."	Inshingano yacu ya mbere kuri twe no ku bihugu bya Afurika igomba guhora ari ukurinda imibereho myiza y'abaturage binyuze muri serivisi z'iterambere, harimo amashanyarazi, ubuvuzi, uburezi, akazi keza ndetse n'ibidukikije, harimo no kubona ibicanwa byiza. Tugomba gushyira imbere gushaka ibisubizo by'ibibazo ku iterambere na no kubungabunga ikirere, kandi ni ngombwa rwose , Osinbajo.
The Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, based in Brussels, says that in 2019, Africa recorded 56 extreme weather events compared to 45 in the previous year.	Ikigo cy’ubushakashatsi kuri Epidemiologiya y’ibiza, gifite icyicaro i Buruseli, kivuga ko muri 2019, Afurika yagize  ibihe bibi 56 by’imihindagurikire y'kirere gikabije ugereranije na 45 mu mwaka ushize.
The extreme weather patterns affected the lives of 16.6 million people in 29 countries. At least 13 million of them were from five countries: Kenya, Mozambique, Somalia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.	Imiterere y'ikirere mibi ikabije yagize ingaruka mbi ku mibereho igera kuri miliyoni 16,6 mu bihugu 29. Nibura miliyoni 13 muri ni izo mu bihugu bitanu: Kenya, Mozambique, Somaliya, Tanzaniya na Zimbabwe.
West Africa had fewer weather-related catastrophes but is feeling the effects of global warming just the same.	Afurika y'Iburengerazuba yagize ingaruka nkeya ku mihindagurikire y' ikirere ariko isigarana ingaruka z'ubushyuhe bw'isi.
Ghana environment minister Kwaku Afriyie explains how climate change has impacted agricultural lands in the country.	Minisitiri w’ibidukikije muri Gana Kwaku Afriyie yasobanuye uburyo imihindagurikire y’ikirere yagize ingaruka ku butaka buhingwa mu gihugu.
"""The harsh and deteriorating climate conditions in northern Ghana undoubtedly energized region-growing food insecurity and seasonal north-to-south migration. And besides, increasing of floods and protracted drought lead to displacement of people. Statistics show that over the last few years, there has been a new internal displacement which has occurred in Ghana due to climate-induced disasters and even beyond our borders,"" he said."	Ikirere kigenda kiba kibi kandi kigenda gihindagurika mu majyaruguru ya Gana nta gushidikanya ko byafashe indi ntera mu turere hagaragara ihenda ry' ibiribwa ndetse no kwimuka bava mu majyaruguru no mu majyepfo. Kandi usibye ko kwiyongera kw’imyuzure n’amapfa byatumye abantu bimurwa. Imibare irerekana ko mu myaka mike ishize, habaye kwimurwa kw'imbere mu gihugu kwabereye muri Gana kubera ibiza biterwa n'ikirere ndetse no hakurya y'umupaka wacu .
The U.N. special representative to the African Union, Hannah Tetteh, said the continent needs to improve cross-border information-sharing and cooperation to handle climate-related crises.	Uhagarariye Umuryango w’abibumbye mu muryango w’ubumwe bw’Afurika, Hannah Tetteh, yavuze ko uyu mugabane ugomba kunoza uburyo bwo guhanahana amakuru ku mipaka n’ubufatanye mu guhangana n’ibibazo biterwa n’ihindagurika ry'ikirere.
"""The challenge has not been that we havent developed yet these structures. The challenge has been we have not utilized them yet effectively, and that goes to issues of national sovereignty and the unwillingness of member states to have others, as it were, take an active interest and maybe recommend the things that need to be done in order to respond to a particular crisis. And if we recognize we are all in this together, then that certainly has to change,"" she said."	Ikibazo gihari si uko  tutaratera imbere mu kubaka izo nzego. Ikibazo ni uko tutigeze tuyikoresha neza, kandi ibyo bikaba bifitanye isano n'ubusugire bw'igihugu ndetse no kudashaka ko ibihugu bigize uyu muryango bigira abandi binjiramo, nk'uko byari bimeze, tugafata Inyungu nyinshi  kandi birashoboka ko dushimangira ibintu bigomba gukorwa kugirango duhangane n’ibibazo ibyo ari byo byose.  Kandi niba tuzi ko twese dufatanyije, ibyo rwose bigomba guhinduka.
As for specific suggestions, Osinbajo suggested governments encourage greater use of natural gas and plant more trees to maintain forests that can soak up carbon dioxide and prevent it from warming the atmosphere.	Ku bijyanye n’ibitekerezo byihariye, Osinbajo yasabye leta gushishikariza abantu gukoresha gaze no gutera ibiti byinshi kugirango habungabungwe amashyamba ashobora kwangizwa na dioxyde de carbone kandi tukirinda ubushyuhe bwinshi mu kirere.

The future looked promising for Tinashe Mapuranga, an intern at a leading bank in Zimbabwe who appeared set to get a staff position as soon as he completed his college degree. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.	Kazoza gasa nkicyizere kuri Tinashe Mapuranga, wimenyereza umwuga muri banki ikomeye muri Zimbabwe wagaragaye ko yiteguye kubona abakozi akimara kurangiza kaminuza. Noneho icyorezo cya COVID-19 cyibasiye.
Amid the lockdowns, the 24-year-old was one of the first to be laid off and has no idea when he'll be able to get his degree because of frequent school closures.

"""It has really affected me a lot in my studies. I have no money to buy data and I don't have a personal laptop to study online and keep up like what others are doing,"" said Mapuranga, who lives with his mother in Chitungwiza, a sprawling working-class area southeast of Harare, the capital."	"Mapuranga ubana na nyina ati: ""Mu by'ukuri byangizeho ingaruka cyane mu masomo yanjye. Nta mafaranga mfite yo gukurikirana amakuru kuko nta mudasobwa igendanwa mfite ngo mbashe kwiga nkoresheje interineti kandi ngo mbashe kugendana n'abandi.

""Mvugishije ukuri, sinzi neza igihe nzarangiriza amashuri ngo mbone impamyabumenyi. Sinzi igihe nzarangiza amashuri ngo mbone akazi kandi nkore ikintu gifatika mu buzima."""
Mapuranga spends most of his time at home, tending a tiny vegetable garden that is the family's main source of food. His mother ekes out a living traveling to South Africa to sell things like stone carvings and brooms on the streets, a trade also badly hit by the pandemic.	Mapuranga amara umwanya munini mu rugo, yita ku busitani buto bw'imboga aribwo kuko ariho akura ibyo kurya  by'umuryango. Nyina yagiye gushakisha imibereho yerekeza muri Afrika yepfo gucuruza ibintu harimo imitako hamwe na sima, ubucuruzi nabwo bwibasiwe n'icyorezo.

My mother is into informal business, but it's also down with these lockdowns. Things are not well right now. It's tough."""	"Ati: ""Twagerageje kwihutira gushakisha amafaranga."" ""Nagerageje gukora ubucuruzi buciriritse bwo kugurisha gaze yo guteka ariko abayobozi batwirukana mu mihanda. Data yarapfuye. Mama ari mu bucuruzi butemewe, ariko nanone si kimwe no kubireka. Ibintu ntabwo bimeze neza muri iki gihe. Birakomeye . """
Mapuranga's situation might look dire, but he says he's concerned about some of his unemployed peers who have fallen into alcohol, drugs and prostitution.	Ikibazo cya Mapuranga gishobora kuba giteye ubwoba, ariko akavuga ko ahangayikishijwe na bamwe mu rungano rwe badafite akazi bishoye mu nzoga, ibiyobyabwenge n'uburaya.
"""Many youths have lost hope,"" he said."	"Ati: ""Urubyiruko rwinshi rwitakarije icyizere."""
Across Africa, many others like Mapuranga are battling the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, losing jobs and seeing their education disrupted, a survey of people aged 18-24 in 15 countries has found.	Hirya no hino muri Afurika, abandi benshi nka Mapuranga bafite ibibazo byatewe n'ihungabana ry'ubukungu ryatewe na COVID-19, Habayeho kubura akazi no kubona amashuri yabo ahungabanye, ibyo bigaragazwa n'ubushakashatsi bwakozwe ku bantu bafite imyaka 18-24 mu bihugu 15 bwerekanye.

Red Cross: 48,000 People Confirmed Missing Across Africa	Croix-Rouge: Yemeje ko abantu 48.000  baburiwe irengero muri Afurika
The International Committee of the Red Cross says more than 48,000 people are missing across Africa, and at least 21,600 are minors. Most of the registered disappearances — widely believed to be a fraction of the continents wider, undocumented humanitarian tragedy — are linked to armed conflict, violence, disasters and migration across the continent.	Komite mpuzamahanga ya Croix-Rouge ivuga ko abantu barenga 48.000 baburiwe irengero muri Afurika, kandi abagera kuri 21,600 ni abana. Benshi mu baburiwe irengero - abantu benshi bemeza ko ababuriwe irengero ari abatuye ku migabane minini, aho ubutabazi budafite ubushobozi bwo kubafasha - kandi izo mfu hari izifitanye isano n’intambara zitwaje intwaro, urugomo, ibiza no kuva ku mugabane  wa Afurika.
The International Committee of the Red Cross says the number of people coming forward to report missing persons is on the rise in Africa.	Komite mpuzamahanga ya Croix-Rouge ivuga ko muri Afurika hari 'abantu baza kurangisha abantu  baburiwe irengero.
Amaya Fernandez, the humanitarian organizations adviser on the missing and their families for Western Africa, says the cause of the increasing numbers is two-fold.	Amaya Fernandez, umujyanama w’imiryango itabara imbabare ku baburiwe irengero hamwe n'imiryango yabo muri Afurika y'Iburengerazuba, avuga ko iburirwa irengero ry'abantu ryiyongereye rikikuba kabiri.
"""On one hand, [it's] due to the fact we are trying to register more systematically cases of missing persons throughout the region. But also, certainly, [it's] due to the increased violence and conflict experienced on the continent, which increases at the same time the likelihood of people going missing. Looking at our figures, almost half of the missing persons have been recorded underage and most of them are men. Among the women ... we can see that the majority are minors,"" she said."	Ku ruhande rumwe, ni ukubera ko tugerageza kubarura baburiwe irengero mu buryo bunonosoye  muri buri karere . Ariko nanone, ni ukubera ko ihohoterwa n'amakimbirane byiyongereye ku mugabane wa Afurika, Ibyo byombi birushaho  kwiyongerera icyarimwe kandi birashoboka ko abantu bazimira.

Zimbabwe Opening Victoria Falls to Vaccinated Tourists	Zimbabwe Opening Victoria yacitse intege mu gukingira abakerarugendo.
Zimbabwe is opening popular tourism destination Victoria Falls to visitors who have been vaccinated against COVID-19, in a move welcomed by the countrys suffering tourism industry. Late Tuesday after a Cabinet meeting, Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa told reporters that the government had resolved to lift a lid on Victoria Falls, the tallest waterfall in the world and the countrys top tourism destination.	Zimbabwe irimo gufungura ahantu nyaburanga h’ubukerarugendo bwa Victoria Falls ku bashyitsi bakingiwe COVID-19, mu rwego rwo kwakirwa n’ibihugu bifite inganda z’ubukerarugendo. Ku wa kabiri, nyuma y’inama y’abaminisitiri, Minisitiri w’itangazamakuru Monica Mutsvangwa yabwiye abanyamakuru ko guverinoma yiyemeje gukingura amarembo ku Isumo rya Victoria, isumo rirerire ku isi ndetse n’ibihugu biza ku isonga mu bukerarugendo.
"""[The] Cabinet acceded to a request by the tourism industry to open the Victoria Falls and Kazungula Border posts to tourists who are fully vaccinated. This is in view of the realization that over 60% of the population in Victoria Falls has been vaccinated. The lockdown measures, however, are being enforced throughout the country in order to curtail a surge under the third wave of COVID-19,"" Mutsvangwa said. Godfrey Koti, spokesman for the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority, says the pandemic had brought the tourism industry worldwide to its knees. He says it is time for Zimbabwe to begin the long climb back with the opening up of Victoria Falls, within the confines and guidelines of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""And from a regional perspective, the tourism traffic will grow and this will send a very strong message to our source markets. This is a definite way of showing, of a benefit being shown from [the] governments drive of vaccinating the entire city of Victoria Falls and subsequently Victoria Falls reaching herd immunity. So, we are very excited to see this happening and it can only show that we are definitely moving in the right direction,"" Koti said. About 1.5 million Zimbabweans out of a population of 14 million have received their first vaccination shot, and nearly 695,000 have received their second inoculation."	"[Inama y'Abaminisitiri yemeye icyifuzo cy’inganda z’ubukerarugendo gukingura iimiryango kuri Victoria kuri buri mukerarugendo wakingiwe byuzuye. Ingamba zo gufunga ariko zirimo gukurikizwa mu gihugu hose hagamijwe kugabanya umuvuduko ukabije wa COVID-19, Mutsvangwa. Godfrey Koti, umuvugizi w’ikigo gishinzwe ubukerarugendo muri Zimbabwe, avuga ko iki cyorezo cyateye kwiyongera kw'inganda z’ubukerarugendo ku isi. Avuga ko igihe kigeze ngo Zimbabwe itangire kuzamuka mu ntera kuko  yafunguye Isumo rya Victoria, mu mabwiriza no mu cyerekezo cy’icyorezo cya COVID-19. ""Kandi ukurikije akarere, urujya n'uruza rw'ubukerarugendo ruzagenda rwiyongera kandi ibyo bizohereza imihahiranire ku masoko yacu. Ubu ni inzira isobanutse tugaragaje, mu nyungu za  guverinoma irashaka gukingiza umujyi wose wa Isumo rya Victoria no munkengero za Victoria Falls..

"Clement Mukwasi, a spokesman for Shearwater, one of the tourism operators in Victoria Falls, sounded an optimistic tone. ""It is the industrys hope that towards the end of the pandemic – which we think we are in – there shall be some credit lines extended to the industry for the industry to recover. We applaud the government for taking our call to open the borders of Zambia and Botswana because Victoria Falls has reached its herd immunity. We are hoping that in addition to opening the borders, they are also going to set up a policy on how people should flow across all three countries,"" he said. Mukwasi said those who are vaccinated should be allowed to move across the country without any problem, while those who are not vaccinated should produce results showing they have tested negative for the coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19. Zimbabwe currently has 101,711 confirmed coronavirus infections and 3,280 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the global outbreak. The government says the vaccination program will intensify after the arrival of more doses from China in the coming days. The number of cases has been rising, as the delta variant becomes more widespread."	"Clement Mukwasi, umuvugizi wa Shearwater, umwe mu bakora ubukerarugendo mu birunga bya Victoria, yagize ati  "" twizera ko inganda zizadufasha kurwanya iki cyorezo -hazashyirwaho umurongo w'inguzanyo uhabwa inganda kugira ngo inganda zisubireho. Turashimira leta kuba yaraduhamagaye kugira ngo dufungure imipaka ya Zambiya na Botswana.Turizera ko usibye gufungura imipaka, bagiye no gushyiraho politiki y'uburyo abantu bagomba gutembera mu bihugu uko ari bitatu "". Mukwasi yavuze ko abakingiwe bagomba kwemererwa kuva mu gihugu nta kibazo, mu gihe abatakingiwe bagomba gutanga ibisubizo byerekana ko bipimishije coronavirus, itera COVID-19. Nk’uko muri kaminuza ya Johns Hopkins ikurikirana iki cyorezo kidasanzwe, muri iki gihe Zimbabwe ifite abantu 101.711 bemeje ko banduye coronavirus n'impfu 3,280. Guverinoma ivuga ko gahunda yo gukingira iziyongera nyuma yo kumara gukingira mu Bushinwa mu gihe kiri imbere. Umubare w'imanza wagiye wiyongera, nkuko delta ihinduka cyane."
UNHCR Voices Concern After Botswana Deports Zimbabwean Refugees	UNHCR yazamuye ijwi m Nyuma yuko  Botswana Yirukanye Impunzi muri Zimbabwe
"The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says it is concerned after Botswana deported 57 Zimbabwean refugees who had lived in the host country since 2008. The refugees reportedly failed to register for voluntary repatriation, which led to their forced removal late last week. The UNHCRs external relations officer, Kate Pond, says the refugees, irrespective of their status, have rights and could have been allowed to remain as permanent residents. ""UNHCR remains concerned that Zimbabweans who have been in Botswana for over a decade have been removed to Zimbabwe in less than voluntary circumstances. Irrespective of their status they still have certain rights, and UNHCR had aimed for alternative solutions, like those provided to Zimbabweans who have family links in Botswana and may be able to remain in the country as permanent residents,"" Pond said. One of the deported refugees, speaking on condition of anonymity, says they were rounded up Thursday and told to board a bus which took them to Zimbabwes border. ""We left Botswana on empty stomachs. We were deported to the border and we didnt get any assistance. We wanted to remain in Botswana; thats why we did not register [for repatriation]. We have nothing, we dont know where to start. We had children going to school. It will be difficult without documents like passports and identity cards,"" the refugee said. The deportees had been living at the Dukwi refugee camp. Botswanas government had warned that refugees who did not register would be deported. Last month, Botswana sent back more than 200 other Zimbabweans who had registered for voluntary repatriation. The repatriated refugees had initially refused to do so, citing fears of persecution in their homeland. Most were opposition activists whose homes were burned down during a deadly presidential election campaign in 2008. But one of the returnees, Bheki Weza, says they have surprisingly been well received in Zimbabwe despite their earlier safety concerns. ""We are very happy about the situation. As we speak, I am now home still trying to settle down and adjust to the difficult economic conditions here in Zimbabwe. But I am happy because there is still peace surrounding us. I have met with the chiefs and even met with people that we fought with before I left. So far so good,"" Weza said. The UNHCR says it will continue to assist refugees who were repatriated. Each person received $520 and a food package. But the agency says there will be no such assistance for the deported refugees."	"Ibiro bya Komiseri Mukuru w’umuryango w’abibumbye ushinzwe impunzi (UNHCR) bivuga ko biteye impungenge nyuma yuko Botswana yirukanye impunzi 57 zo muri Zimbabwe zari zituye mu gihugu cyari cyarabakiriye kuva mu 2008.

"""Before the introduction of mushroom farming in this place, it was very tough for people in this community to survive because of the lockdowns and so forth. But when The Future of Hope [a nonprofit committed to skills empowerment] brought in mushroom growing, its changing because you can now buy something, able to go to shops and buy mielie meal [coarse flour], sugar and so forth.

Zuma, who was ousted from the ruling African National Congress in 2018 after nearly two decades as president, has pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering in the long-running case over the $2 billion arms deal in the 1990s.	Zuma wirukanwe muri Kongere y’ibihugu Nyafurika  ari kubutegetsi kuva mu mwaka wa 2018 amaze imyaka igera kuri makumyabiri abaye perezida, yahakanye icyaha ashinjwa cya ruswa, kunyereza amafaranga n’ubujura buciye icyuho mu rubanza rumaze igihe kinini kubera amasezerano kubera  amasezerano yushe yo kwishyura miliyari 2 z'amadolari mu myaka ya za 90.

South Africa’s Neutral Stance on Russia Risks International Ties: Analysts	Abasesenguzi bavuga ko kuba Afurika yepfo iterekana uruhande ibogamiyeho kubiri kubera mu burusiya, Bishobora guteza amakimbirane mpuzamahanga
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday defended his neutral stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling for talks — not condemnation.	Ku wa mbere, Perezida wa Afurika y'Epfo, Cyril Ramaphosa, yasobanuye ukutabogama kwe hagati ya Ukraine n' UBurusiya avuga ko hakwiye ibiganiro -Kurwana bikarorera..
Critics have blasted the government for failing to support Ukraine against its neighbor. Analysts say South Africa is allowing historic political and economic ties with Moscow to risk relations with the rest of the world.	Abatavugarumwe n'ubutegetsi, bamaganye guverinoma kubera ko yananiwe gushyigikira Ukraine ngo barwanye umuturanyi wayo. Abasesenguzi bavuga ko Afurika y'Epfo ishaka umubano mwiza wa politiki n'ubukungu ikaba idashaka ko Moscou yahungabanya umubano n'isi yose.
Negotiation rather than weapons or economic pressure is the mechanism Ramaphosa would like to see used to settle the Russia-Ukraine conflict.	Ashaka ko habaho Ibiganiro aho kujya mu mirwano cyangwa igitutu cy'ubukungu nibwo buryo Ramaphosa yifuza kubona bwakoreshwa mu gukemura amakimbirane y’Uburusiya na Ukraine.
Ramaphosas unwavering stance overruled an earlier call by the countrys international relations department for Russia to withdraw its forces.	Ramaphosas yamaganye yivuye inyuma icyifuzo cyari cyarashyizweho n’ishami mpuzamahanga ry’ububanyi n’amahanga mu Burusiya ryo  gukurayo ingabo.

"""The Department of International Relations and Cooperation, [which] is largely the diplomat for South Africa, their initial instinct was to say, ‘Well, this was not acceptable. And that was kind of pulled back by the president who I think has this concern about allies and Russian and what this looks like,"" Jernberg said. ""So even within South Africa, South Africa's position is very contested, even within government."""	"Ishami ry’ububanyi n’amahanga n’ubutwererane, rikaba ahanini rigizwe n,aba dipolomate bo muri Afurika yepfo, icyo bashyize imbere na mbere ni uko bitari byemewe. Kandi ibyo byari byarakuweho na perezida kandi baratekereza ko byakuwe ho n'abafatanyabikorwa hamwe n'Uburusiya  "", Jernberg. ati""Ndetse no muri Afurika y'Epfo, umwanya wa Perezida  wa Afurika y'Epfo urahatanirwa cyane ndetse n'indi myanya yo muri guverinoma."""
South Africas ties to Russia stretch back to the 1960s when the Soviet Union gave support to anti-apartheid freedom fighters.	Umubano w'Afurika y'Epfo n'Uburusiya watangiye mu myaka ya za 1960 igihe Leta Zunze Ubumwe z'Abasoviyeti zateraga inkunga abaharanira ubwigenge bwa apartheid.
In subsequent years, politicians, including those from the ruling party, the African National Congress, maintained close ties with Russia.	Mu myaka yakurikiyeho, abanyapolitiki, harimo n'abo mu ishyaka riri ku butegetsi, Kongere Nyafurika, bakomeje umubano wa hafi n'Uburusiya.
Which is why analysts said its no surprise that a foundation headed by former president Jacob Zuma has voiced support for Russias Vladimir Putin.	Akaba ari yo mpamvu abasesenguzi bavuze ko bidatangaje ko umusingi uyobowe n'uwahoze ari perezida Jacob Zuma wagaragaje ko ushyigikiye Russias Vladimir Putin.
Richard Calland is a public law professor at the University of Cape Town.	Richard Calland ni umwarimu wigisha amategeko muri kaminuza ya Cape Town.
"""He [Putin] had a very close relationship with our former President, Jacob Zuma,"" Calland said. ""It was a corrupt relationship. It fueled an illegal in the end, the court said, illegal procurement of Russian nuclear power, which was stopped by the courts. And I fear that that interferes at least with some political attitudes in South Africa. But I don't believe that it was the direct reason for the position that South Africa has taken."""	"Calland ati: ""[Putin] yari afitanye umubano wa hafi n'uwahoze ari Perezida wacu, Jacob Zuma."" Urukiko rwagize ruti: ""Byari umubano wa ruswa. Byongereye ingufu mu buryo butemewe n'amategeko, amaherezo urukiko ruvuga ko kugura intwaro za kirimbuzi z’Uburusiya mu buryo butemewe n'amategeko, byabujijwe n’inkiko. Ati Kandi mfite ubwoba ko ibyo bibangamira imikorere ya politiki muri Afurika y'Epfo. Ati ""Ariko Ntabwo nizera ko ari yo mpamvu itaziguye yatumye Afurika y'Epfo ifata. """
Instead, Calland says, South African officials are simply following the countrys standard position on foreign conflicts.	Ahubwo, Calland avuga ko abayobozi ba Afurika y'Epfo bakurikiza gusa ibihugu bisanzwe ku makimbirane yo mu mahanga.
"""I'm well acquainted with and in close contact with South Africa's kind of senior diplomatic officials, and they are very steeped in this tradition of non-alignment,"" Calland said. ""Political dialogue is their middle name, so to speak. And I think that on this one, they wanted to maintain this kind of nonpartisan position in order to promote that dialogue."""	"Calland ati: ""Nzi neza kandi nkorana cyane n'abayobozi bakuru ba dipolomasi bo muri Afurika y'Epfo, kandi bakomereje kuri uyu muco wo kudahuza."" ""Ibiganiro bya politiki ni izina ryabo ryo hagati, mu buryo bw'ikigereranyo. Kandi ndatekereza ko kuri iyi, bifuzaga gukomeza imyanya nk'iyi itabogamye kugira ngo bateze imbere ibyo biganiro."""
Another factor at play is the countrys position within the economic bloc, BRICS, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.	Ikindi kintu kigaragara ni umwanya w'ibihugu bigize umuryango w'ubukungu, BRICS, irimo Burezili, Uburusiya, Ubuhinde, Ubushinwa na Afrika yepfo.
Analysts said South Africa may be attempting to maintain trade relations with Russia and China.	Abasesenguzi bavuze ko Afurika y'Epfo ishobora kugerageza gukomeza umubano w'ubucuruzi n'Uburusiya n'Ubushinwa.
But international relations expert Jernberg said that stance is ultimately counterproductive.	Ariko impuguke mu mibanire mpuzamahanga Jernberg yavuze ko iyo myifatire idahwitse.
"""In that case, we're actually backing the wrong horse,"" Jernberg said. ""When you look at the EU, the European Union as a block, South Africas combined trade to the European Union is actually far larger. And so then if you're going to make an economic argument, you should surely be arguing that between the United States and between, and Europe, is actually a greater economic interest."""	"Jernberg ati: ""Icyo gihe, mu by'ukuri twaba dushyigikiye ibintu bitari byo."" ""Iyo urebye Umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi nk'’umudugudu, Afurika yepfo yahujije ubucuruzi n’umubano ukomeye hagati y'ibihugu by’Uburayi. Noneho rero niba ugiye kujya impaka zishingiye ku bukungu, ugomba rwose kujya impaka kubihugu bya Amerika yo hagati n'Uburayi, mu by'ukuri ifitemo inyungu nyinshi mu bukungu. """
Whatever the motives, it has left Western nations siding with Ukraine disappointed, and experts warn there could be implications for South Africa in the future.	Impamvu yaba ari yo yose, yatumye ibihugu by’iburengerazuba byshyigikiraga Ukraine biyitenguha, abahanga bavuga ko hashobora kubaho ingaruka kuri Afurika yepfo mu bihe biri imbere.

"""These kinds of things down the road, become problematic,"" Gouws said. ""If you don't display that kind of cooperation and sound thinking, and firm condemnation when a country does something like this, down the road, it bites you when you need support from the international community."""	"Gouws ati: ""Ibintu nk'ibi mu muhanda, biba ikibazo."" ""Niba utagaragaje ubwo bufatanye n'ibitekerezo byumvikana, no kwamaganwa ushikamye iyo igihugu gikora ibintu nk'ibi, mu muhanda, biragorana mugihe ukeneye inkunga y'umuryango mpuzamahanga."""
While the ramifications for South Africa remain uncertain, experts agree its unlikely the country will change its position any time soon.	Kubera impinduka zabaye muri Afurika y'Epfo zidashidikanywaho, abahanga bemeza ko bidashoboka ko igihugu kizahindura imibereho vuba aha.
Interpol Issues Red Notices for Gupta Brothers Wanted in South Africa	Interpol Itanga inzandiko zo gufata abashakishwa muri Afrika yepfo
South Africa said this week the International Criminal Police Organization, Interpol, has requested countries seek out and arrest Rajesh and Atul Gupta, two brothers and businessmen who allegedly bribed top officials, including former president Jacob Zuma, to gain lucrative government contracts.	Afurika y'Epfo yavuze ko kuri iki cyumweru Umuryango mpuzamahanga w'urukiko  mpanabyaha, Interpol, wasabye ibihugu gushakisha no guta muri yombi Rajesh na Atul Gupta, abavandimwe babiri n' abacuruzi bivugwa ko baha ruswa abayobozi bakuru, barimo uwahoze ari perezida Jacob Zuma, kugira ngo babone amasezerano y'inyungu kuri leta.
"South African anti-corruption activists have accused the Guptas of ""state capture,"" a term meant to describe the brothers' strong influence over former president Zuma and members of his Cabinet — influence that allegedly extended to contracts, policy and personnel choices."	"Abaharanira kurwanya ruswa muri Afurika y'Epfo bashinje Guptas Gufata ibya Leta"",  rikaba rigamije gusobanura uruhare rukomeye rw'abavandimwe  bahoze ari perezida Zuma ndetse n'abagize Guverinoma ye - bikaba bivugwa ko bikubiye mu masezerano, politiki no guhitamo abakozi."
While there are many allegations against the Guptas, the red notices — requests to member nations to arrest — were issued for a case involving a relatively small $1.5 million pertaining to procurement fraud.	Nubwo hari ibirego byinshi bishinja Guptas, inzandiko zo gufata abantu zisaba ibihugu bigize uyu muryango guta muri yombi abantu- byatanzwe kubera urubanza rwa miliyoni 1.5 z'amadolari yavuye mu buriganya bw'amasoko.
South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority requested the red notices last year, but Rajesh and Atul Guptas' lawyers objected. The application had to be reviewed by Interpol to make sure, among other things, that there was no political bias.	Ikigo cy’igihugu gishinzwe ubushinjacyaha muri Afurika yepfo kihanangirijwe umwaka ushize, ariko abunganizi ba Rajesh na Atul Guptas barabyanze. Gusaba byagombaga gusubirwamo na Interpol kugirango harebwe ikindi cyakorwa, ko nta kubogama mu bya  politiki kwabayeho.
Interpol's ambassador for the Turn Back Crime Campaign, Andy Mashaile, said South Africa also took time to secure an extradition treaty with the United Arab Emirates, as it's believed the brothers are in Dubai.	Ambasaderi wa Interpol mu gikorwa cyo gusubiza inyuma iperereza, Andy Mashaile, yavuze ko Afurika y'Epfo nayo yafashe igihe cyo kugirana amasezerano yo koherezwa mu mahanga na Leta zunze ubumwe z'Abarabu, kuko bizeraga ko ari abavandimwe bari i Dubai.
"""You can then go to Interpol Dubai and say: 'Interpol Dubai, we know this is the place where the guys are living, this is the street name and the street number, this is how they look, these are their images. Please help us get these people in your detention center or in your cell, in jail until we are able to fetch them from Dubai,'"" Mashaile said."	Ushobora noneho ubu  kujya muri Interpol Dubai ukavuga uti: 'Interpol Dubai, tuzi ko aha ariho hantu abasore batuye, iri ni izina ry'umuhanda na nimero y'umuhanda, ni uburyo basa, aya ni amashusho yabo. Nyamuneka nimumfashe dushyire abo bantu muri gereza ya hano cyangwa muri kasho ya hano  kugeza igihe tuzabasha kubavana i Dubai, 'Mashaile.
Interpol has 194 member countries and, while red notices do not compel them to execute arrests, the notices do help in tracking the whereabouts of suspects or fugitives. Their photographs are posted on all local law enforcement systems.	Interpol ifite ibihugu 194 bigize uyu muryango kandi, mugihe urwandiko rwo gufata abantu  zitabahatira guhita zibafata ,amatangazo afasha mugukurikirana aho abakekwaho icyaha cyangwa abahunze bari. Amafoto yabo ashyirwa kuri sisitemu zose zubahiriza amategeko.
Political analyst Sanusha Naidu of the Institute for Global Dialogue said the red notices could help the 2024 reelection campaign of South Africa's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, because it shows he is taking action against corruption.	Umusesenguzi wa politiki Sanusha Naidu wo mu kigo gishinzwe ibiganiro ku isi yavuze ko inzandiko zo gufata abantu zushobora gufasha mu kwiyamamaza kwa 2024 kwa perezida wa Afurika y'Epfo, Cyril Ramaphosa, kuko byerekana ko arimo gufata ingamba zo kurwanya ruswa.
"""But I think what it also suggests is that at an international level, you know, getting the international community and, in particular, Interpol to also take a stance and align with the position that Ramaphosa has,"" Naidu said. ""So, I think in terms of him moving forward and trying to say to the South African public, I'm doing what I have to do. I'm working around this, I'm moving the needle on this."""	"Naidu ati: ""Ariko ntekereza ko icyo nacyo cyerekana ko ari uko ku rwego mpuzamahanga, murabizi, kubona umuryango mpuzamahanga, cyane cyane Interpol nayo igafata icyemezo igahuza n'umwanya Ramaphosa afite"". ""Rero, ndatekereza ko kubijyanye no gutera imbere no kugerageza kubwira abaturage ba Afrika yepfo, nkora ibyo ngomba gukora. Ndimo nkora ibishoboka byose,"
However, Naidu said she's not sure it's enough to redeem the African National Congress, which has steadily been losing support at the polls because of rampant corruption and failure to deliver basic services.	Icyakora, Naidu yavuze ko atazi neza ko kuvugurura Kongere y’ibihugu Nyafurika byaba byiza, yagiye ibura ubushobozi mu matora kubera ruswa ikabije mugutanga serivisi z’ibanze.
"""I think if you want to talk about what ordinary South Africans want, they want to see the judicial system take its natural course,"" she said. ""But the question also is all the money that's been taken from the country, how does that come back? Because if you think about it, that's where part of the challenge lies."""	"Ati: ""Ntekereza ko niba ushaka kuvuga ku byo Abanyafurika y'Epfo basanzwe bashaka, bifuza kubona inzego z'ubutabera zikurikiza uburyo busanzwe ""Ariko ikibazo nacyo ni amafaranga yose yakuwe mu gihugu, ibyo bizagaruka bite? Kubera ko iyo ubitekereje, aho niho ikibazo kiri."""
News of the red notices broke a day before the release of the third report from the Inquiry into State Capture. It called for the National Prosecuting Authority to investigate Zuma. The former president refused to appear before the inquiry and was jailed for 15 months after defying a court order to do so. However, he was let out on medical parole soon after.	Amakuru adasanzwe yatangajwe umunsi umwe mbere yuko hasohoka raporo ya gatatu ivuye mu iperereza ryakozwe mu gufata ibya Leta. Yasabye ikigo cy'igihugu gishinzwe ubushinjacyaha gukora iperereza kuri Zuma. Uwahoze ari perezida yanze kwitaba iperereza maze afungwa amezi 15 nyuma yo kwanga icyemezo cy'urukiko. Icyakora, yahise arekurwa by'agateganyo.

As Desmond Tutu turns 90 on Thursday, he remains indisputably the moral voice of South Africa. But age is catching up with him.	Ku wa kane, ubwo Desmond Tutu yujuje imyaka 90, akomeza kuba ijwi rya rubanda ryamagana Aparteid muri  Afurika y'Epfo. Ariko imyaka agera aho arasaza
The jovial emeritus archbishop retired in 2010 and rarely speaks in public, in a country that sometimes feels adrift without the leadership of its anti-apartheid liberation icons.	Arkiyepiskopi wa jovial emeritus yagiye mu kiruhuko cy'izabukuru mu mwaka wa 2010 kandi ni gake avugira mu ruhame, mu gihugu rimwe na rimwe cyumvikana nta buyobozi  bugaragaragaza ko igihugu kibohoye.
Even though South Africa has eased its COVID-19 precautions, the birthday festivities will be muted and largely online.	Nubwo Afrika yepfo yoroheje ingamba zo kwirinda COVID-19, ibirori byo kwizihiza isabukuru bizimurwa .
Renowned for his radiating energy and infectious laughter, Tutu is expected to attend a special service Thursday at St George's Cathedral, where he once held the pulpit as South Africa's first black Anglican archbishop.	Azwiho kuba afite imbaraga zo gusetsa cyane, biteganijwe ko Tutu azitabira ibirori bidasanzwe kuri Katedrali ya St George, aho yigeze gufata mimbari nka musenyeri mukuru wa mbere w’abirabura bo muri Afurika yepfo.

The line-up of speakers is a reminder of Tutu's values, surrounding himself with rights advocates at a time when South Africa's current leaders are better known for lavish lifestyles and billion-dollar bank accounts.	Mu kumwibuka,  afite indangagaciro, aharanira uburenganzira mu gihe abayobozi ba Afurika y'Epfo bo bazwiho kwita ku mibereho myiza yabo ndetse na konti zabo zikaba zuzuyeho amadorari.

Knowing him now as a towering figure on the world stage, it's hard to remember that when he returned from his studies in Britain in the 1960s, he was subjected to the same humiliations as any other black South African.	Kumenya ubu nkumuntu ukomeye cyane kurwego rw'isi, biragoye kwibuka ko ubwo yagarukaga avuye kwiga mu Bwongereza mu myaka ya za 1960, yarasuzuguwe nk’abandi Banyafrika yepfo kuko ari abirabura.

Yahimbye ijambo ""igihugu cy'umukororombya"", kandi yizera cyane ko igeragezwa rya Afurika y'Epfo rishobora kwereka isi inzira nshya yo gutsinda amakimbirane."
His ideas of forgiveness have fallen out of favor with some younger South Africans, who feel that black people surrendered too much in the transition to democracy, without holding apartheid criminals to account.	Igitekerezo cye cyo gutanga imbabazi ntikishimiwe na bamwe mu ru byiruko rwo muri Afurika y'Epfo, bumva ko abirabura bitanze cyane mu gihe cya demokarasi, bityo batagomba gukurkkiranwa kubyaha bya apartheid.

South Africa Floods Could Hurt China Trade	Afurika y'Epfo Umwuzure ushobora guhungabanya ubucuruzi bw'Ubushinwa
Some of the worst flooding in South Africas history has left more than 400 people dead and some 40,000 displaced, dealing a devastating blow to the eastern city of Durban, which has a seaport that has also been badly affected.	Imwe mu myuzure ikabije yabayeho mu mateka ya Afurika y'Epfo yahitanye abantu barenga 400 abandi bagera ku 40.000 bavanywe mu byabo, bikaba byibasiye umujyi wa Durban wo mu burasirazuba, ufite icyambu nacyo cyagizweho ingaruka mbi.
With the port not fully functioning, there are supply chain concerns and China — South Africas biggest trading partner — and other nations, are likely to see their imports and exports disrupted.	Kubera ko icyambu kidakora neza, hari impungenge z’ibicuruzwa kandi Ubushinwa - Afurika yepfo ni abafatanyabikorwa bakomeye mu bucuruzi - ndetse n’ibindi bihugu, birashoboka ko ibyoherezwa mu mahanga byahungabana.
Earlier this week, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a national state of disaster because of the flooding — which he blames on climate change but which some critics blame on poor infrastructure and the fact that most of the people affected were living in makeshift shacks in informal settlements.	Mu ntangiriro z'iki cyumweru, Perezida wa Afurika y'Epfo, Cyril Ramaphosa, yatangaje ko igihugu kirimo ibiza biterwa n’umwuzure - we avuga ko ari  imihindagurikire y’ikirere ariko bamwe mu bamunegura bavuga ko ari ibikorwa remezo bidakomeye ndetse n’uko benshi mu baturage bibasiwe ari ababaga mu nkambi mu buryo butemewe bwo gutura.
"Ramaphosa stressed the importance of quickly fixing the situation at the port, saying, ""The Port of Durban — which is one of the largest and busiest shipping terminals on the continent and which is vital to our countrys economy — has been severely affected."""	"Ramaphosa yashimangiye akamaro ko gutunganya vuba icyo cyambu, agira ati: ""Icyambu cya Durban - Ni kimwe mu bintu bikomeye kandi gikoreshwa n'abantu benshi ku mugabane wa Afurika kandi kikaba ari ingenzi cyane mu bukungu bw'igihugu cyacu - cyagize ingaruka zikomeye."""
The road to the port, which handles some 13,000 heavy vehicles a day, has been severely damaged, he added.	Yongeyeho ko umuhanda ujya ku cyambu utwara imodoka zigera ku 13.000 ku munsi, wangiritse cyane.
On Tuesday, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan Pravin Gordhan visited the port, which has reopened, and concluded it would take more a week to clear some backlogs. The rail network to the site had been affected by landslides and still needs to be repaired, he said, adding that 9,000 containers have accumulated at the port and would be cleared in the next nine days.	Ku wa kabiri, Minisitiri w’ibigo bya Leta, Pravin Gordhan, Pravin Gordhan, yasuye icyambu cyongeye gufungura, avuga ko bizatwara icyumweru kugira ngo bakureho igihombo cyateje. Umuyoboro wa gari ya moshi ujya aho hantu wari wibasiwe n'inkangu kandi n'ubu uracyakeneye gusanwa, akomeza avuga ko kontineri 9000 zegeranije ku cyambu kandi ko zizahakurwa mu minsi icyenda iri imbere.
Logs and debris also ended up in the harbor due to the floods, which he said had disrupted shipping.	Ibiti n'imyanda nabyo byageze ku cyambu kubera umwuzure, yavuze ko byahagaritse ubwikorezi.
One of the countries likely to be affected by problems at the port is China, said Cobus van Staden, senior China-Africa researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs.	Cobus van Staden, umushakashatsi mukuru mu Bushinwa na Afurika mu kigo cy’ububanyi n’amahanga cya Afurika yepfo, yatangaje ko kimwe mu bihugu bishobora guhura n’ibibazo biri kuri icyo cyambu ari Ubushinwa.
"""In relation to the situation in Durban, its very serious for the whole of China-Africa trade, rather than just for South Africa; this is because of the centrality of Durban port to Chinese exports,"" he told VOA."	"Yatangarije VOA agira ati: ""Ku bijyanye n'ibibera i Durban, birakomeye cyane ku bucuruzi bwose bw'Ubushinwa na Afurika, aho kuba Afurika y'Epfo gusa; ibi biterwa n'icyambu cya Durban cyohereza ibicuruzwa mu Bushinwa."""
"""About 20 percent of total China-Africa trade goes out through Durban and this includes resources like cobalt, copper and lithium coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe particularly,"" he added."	"Yongeye ati: ""Hafi 20 ku ijana by'ubucuruzi bwose bw'Ubushinwa na Afurika buva muri Durban kandi hanyura umutungo kamere nka cobalt, umuringa na lithium biva muri Repubulika Iharanira Demokarasi ya Kongo na Zimbabwe."""
Maersk, the worlds biggest container line, halted operations at the port last week and told VOA by email its warehouse had been affected and was still not operational. While vessel operations had resumed, the company said problems with road access were affecting all cargo entering or leaving the terminal.	Maersk, umuyoboro munini wa kontineri ku isi, wahagaritse ibikorwa ku cyambu mu cyumweru gishize maze ubwira VOA kuri imeri ko ububiko bwawo bwagizweho ingaruka kandi ko butari bwasanwa. Mu gihe ibikorwa by'ubwato byari byongeye gusubukurwa, isosiyete yavuze ko ibibazo byo kubona umuhanda bigira akamaro kubwikorezi bw'imizigo yose yinjira cyangwa isohoka.
"""We continue to assess the damages and monitor the situation as it evolves, customers are being updated daily on the progress and the contingency plans so that we may get the supply chains moving again as quickly as possible,"" it said."	"Baragira bati: ""Tuzakomeza gusuzuma ibyangiritse no gukurikirana uko ibintu bigenda byiyongera, abakiriya bagenda bavugururwa buri munsi aho bigeze ndetse na gahunda zihutirwa kugira ngo tubone uburyo bwo kongera kugemura vuba bishoboka""."
Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist for the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, told VOA he thought it would take some time before activities at the port were back to normal.	Wandile Sihlobo, impuguke mu by'ubukungu mu rugaga rw’ubucuruzi rw’ubuhinzi muri Afurika yepfo, yabwiye Ijwi rya Amerika ko yatekereje ko bizatwara igihe mbere yuko ibikorwa byo ku cyambu bisubira mu buryo.
"""Theres been great devastation by these excessive rains and its a major risk to commerce and all goods: automobile, agriculture and other sectors of the economy that are dependent on trade,"" he said."	"Ati: ""Theres yangijwe cyane n'iyi mvura ikabije kandi yagezweho n'ingaruka zikomeye ku bucuruzi n'ibicuruzwa byose: imodoka, ubuhinzi n'izindi nzego z'ubukungu bushingiye ku bucuruzi""."

Officials are still quantifying the damage to critical infrastructure like the Durban Port, highways and telecommunications.	Abayobozi baracyakusanya ibyangiritse ku bikorwa remezo bikomeye nka Port ya Durban, umuhanda munini n’itumanaho.
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs who is leading the response, told a media briefing Tuesday the scale of the disaster requires a national response.	Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, minisitiri w’imiyoborere y’amakoperative n’ibikorwa gakondo uri kuruhembe rwo gushaka ibisubizo,, yatangarije abanyamakuru ko ku wa Kabiri ko urwego cy’igihugu ruzatanga igisubizo.
"""In a way it gives hope and also is a vessel for coordination and rallying the entire nation, the entire government and also the international support,"" Dlamini-Zuma said."	"Dlamini-Zuma ati: ""Mu buryo bwo gutanga ikuzere nkinzira yo guhuriza hamwe abanyagihugu, guverinoma yose yasabye inkunga mpuzamahanga."""
Climate change was highlighted as a cause of the floodings severity. But poor infrastructure and city planning — with many informal settlements located in vulnerable low-lying areas — was another factor.	Imihindagurikire y’ibihe yagaragaye nk'impamvu y’imyuzure ikabije. Ariko ibikorwa remezo bidahwitse hamwe n'igishushanyo mbonera cy'umujyi - hamwe n'abantu benshi batuye ahantu hatuwe cyane
Dlamini-Zuma said while the disaster brought a great deal of sorrow, it also poses an opportunity.	Dlamini-Zuma yavuze ko ibiza byateje umubabaro mwinshi.
"""We should be building back better,"" Dlamini-Zuma said. ""Nobody should build back in the riverbanks and in floodplains but also in some of the areas that are geographically not right for residential areas."""	"Dlamini-Zuma ati: ""Tugomba kubaka neza ku rushaho."" ""Nta muntu ukwiye kongera kubaka mu nkombe z'umugezi no mu kibaya aho umwuzure ugera ahubwo hari uturere tumwe na tumwe tutari dukwiye guturwamo"""
But people living in the worst-hit communities, particularly informal settlements in low-lying areas, say they doubt promises of better housing will be kept.	Ariko abantu batuye mu gace  kibasiwe cyane, ntibemerewe gutura mu buryo butemewe, mu bibaya, bavuga ko bafite impungenge ku masezerano y’imiturire myiza ntibazi ko  izubahirizwa.
The settlement called Mega Village in south Durban had been hit by floods in 2017 and 2019. Cosmos Khanyeza, a community volunteer, helped victims in the earlier floods and last weeks.	Umudugudu witwa Mega uri mu majyepfo ya Durban wari wibasiwe n’umwuzure muri 2017 na 2019. Cosmos Khanyeza, umukorerabushake w’abaturage, yafashije abahohotewe n’umwuzure wabanje ndetse mu byumweru bishize.
"""Those people are looking at the proper way to be away from that river so that they won't become victims again,"" he said. ""Those people from 2019 floods didn't get any help. They were just in their transition camp houses. There was a budget for them but they never even seen a cent of that budget."""	"Ati: ""Abo bantu barimo kureba inzira iboneye yo gutura kure y'uruzi kugira ngo batazongera kuba ibitambo"". ""Abo bantu kuva haba mwuzure muri  2019 nta mfashanyo babonye. Bari mu nkambi. Hari ingengo y’imari kuri bo ariko ntibigeze babona n'ijana ry'ingengo y'imari."""
Khanyeza said most people cant afford to rebuild, let alone look for safer areas to erect a new metal shack.	Khanyeza yavuze ko abantu benshi badashobora kwiyubaka, kereka niba dushakisha ahantu hizewe kugira ngo hubakwe amazu mashya.
For now, he said, foam mattresses and blankets were delivered by the government Monday so victims can sleep more comfortably at a temporary shelter in a community hall.	Ubu, yavuze ko matelas n’ibiringiti byatanzwe na guverinoma ku wa mbere kugira ngo abavanywe mu byabo basinzire neza mu buhungiro bw’agateganyo.
Sooliman, who leads Gift of the Givers, said recovering the dead and basic humanitarian needs remain the focus before larger infrastructure can be considered.	Sooliman uyobora ibijyanye n'imfashanyo zitangwa,  yavuze ko kugarura abantu mubuzima busanzwe n'ibikorwa by'ibanze by'ubutabazi ari byo bikomeje kwibandwaho mbere y'ibikorwa remezo binini.
"""People have lost everything, all their material values,"" Sooliman said. ""So basically the funding is, right off, the simple stuff. And then of course you repair the schools and the hospitals."""	"Sooliman ati: ""Abantu babuze byose, indangagaciro zabo zose."" ""Muri rusange rero. Inkunga yabo irihutirwa. Hanyuma birumvikana nyuma hazaza gusana amashuri n'ibitaro."""
Officials said the port of Durban, the busiest in southern Africa, has been severely disrupted by the weather but will be cleared and operational again in the next six days. Other timelines for rebuilding roads and repairing more than 600 schools have yet to be announced.	Abayobozi bavuze ko icyambu cya Durban gikoreshwa n' abantu benshi cyane muri Afurika yepfo, cyahungabanijwe cyane n’ikirere ariko kikazasukurwa kandi kizongera gukora mu minsi itandatu iri imbere. Ikindi gihe byo kubaka imihanda no gusana amashuri arenga 600 ntibiratangazwa.
Officials said the overall disaster declaration is expected to remain in place for three months to provide enough time and resources to rebuild.	Abayobozi bavuze ko muri rusange iteganyagihe kubijyanye  n'ibiza riteganijwe mu mezi atatu kugira ngo ritange igihe gihagije abantu bitegure mu by'ubukungu .
