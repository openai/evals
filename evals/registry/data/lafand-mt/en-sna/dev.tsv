Malawi to Conduct Door-to-Door HIV Testing	Malawi ichateedza imba neimba ichiongorora ropa maringe nedenda reshuramatongo
Malawians have mixed reactions to government plans to introduce door-to door HIV testing early next year. 	Vanhu vemuMalawi vane maonera akasiyana pamusoro pehurongwa hwehurumende hwekutanga kuongorora ropa kuitira reshuramatongo gore rinouya richingotanga, ichiita zvekuteedza imba neimba.
Supporters say the step is urgently needed because 100 Malawians get infected each day, and an average of 138 die from AIDS daily. 	Vanotsigira zano iri vanoti chirongwa ichi chinyanya kudiwa nekuti vanhu vemuMulawi zana vanobata chirwere ichi zuva nezuva, uye vanhu vangasvike zana nemakumi matatu nemasere vanofa nekuda kweshuramatongo zuva nezuva.
Minister of Health Jean Kalirani announced the plans during the recent commemoration of World AIDS Day in the northern district of Karonga.	Gurokota rezvehutano Jean Kalirani avakazivisa hurongwa uhwu pamusi wekucherechedza zuva reshuramatongo reWorld AIDS Day rakaitwa muchinguva chichangodarika mudunhu rekumaodzanyemba reKaronga.
We will go in the villages asking for blood samples to check whether that person is HIV positive or not. 	Tichaenda kumamisha tichikumbira kutora madonhwe eropa kuti tione kuti munhu anedenda reshuramatongo here kana kuti kwete.
And those that will be found HIV positive will definitely be given the care they need. 	Vose vanenge vawanikwa vaine denda reshuramatongo zvirokwazvo vachapihwa kubatsirwa nekuchengetwa kwavanenge vachida.
And those who are found negative will also be counseled so that they remain negative, said Kalirani.	Uye avo venenge vawanikwa vasina denda iri vachapihwa mazano kuitira kuti varambe vasina denda iri, akadaro Kalirani.
Kalirani said the campaign will start in mid-March and will aim to reach everyone in the country, including people who are far from health facilities that provide HIV testing and counseling services. 	Kalirani akati chirongwa ichi chichatanga pakati paKurume uye chichange chiine donzvo rekubata munhu wese munyika, kusanganisira vanhu vari kure nenzvimbo dzinobatsira nezvehutano nekuongorora ropa pane zveshuramatongo nekupa mazano nezvedenda iri.
She said the campaign is in line with the goal of ending HIV infection by 2030. 	Vakati hurongwa uhwu hwuri maringe nechinangwa chekupedza shuramatongo panosvika gore ra2030.
Malawi's HIV infection rate is currently at 10 percent, a slight drop from three years ago.	Hwuwandu hwekupararira kwedenda reshuramatongo muMalawi ikezvino huri pazvikamu gumi kubva pazana, zvichiratidza kuderera zvishoma kubva pane zvakange zviri makore matatu apfuura.
The announcement has raised fears in some Malawians, such as Steven Jailosi, a primary school teacher in rural Blantyre, who feel the campaign will likely infringe upon peoples privacy.	Chiziviso ichi chakaunza  kuvhunduka nekutya mukati mevamwe vanhu vemuMalawi, saSteven Jailosi, mudzidzisi wechikoro chevana vadiki mumaruwa eBlantyre, anofunga kuti chirongwa ichi chichabvongodza nekufumura zvhinhu zvevanhu zvavanoda kuti zvive zvakavanzikana.
I think it is not okay because they will be invading our privacy. HIV testing is supposed to be private.	Handifunge kuti zvakanaka nekuti vanenge vopindira vasina kutenderwa kuti vazive zvakavanzikana zvedu.
No one is supposed to know that I went for an HIV testing unless I make a choice to tell them, said Jailosi.	Kuongororwa ropa maringe nedenda resurmatongo chinofanirwa kuva chinhu chinoitwa pakavanzikana. Hapana anofanirwa kuziva kuti ndakaenda kunoongorwa ropa, kuzhe kwekuti ndaita sarudzo yekuvaudza, akadaro Jailosi.
Ester Makonokaya, a secretary in Blantyre, said that although she has been tested already, she feels the door-to-door HIV testing will violate people's privacy.	Ester Makonokaya, anoshanda semunyori muBlantyre, akati kunyangwe akatoongorwa ropa rake kare, anofunga kuti zvekuteedza imba neimba kuchiongorora ropa maringe neshuramatongo zvinofumura zvakavanzikana zvevanhu.
Government should instead take the mobile clinics to the villages where people will be able to access them on their own rather than taking testing in their homes, because that might mean that some of the people who are not supposed to know other peoples status will know because, you know, when someone has been tested you show some reactions, said Makonokaya.	Hurumende inofanirwa kuendesa zvipatara zvinotenderera zvichienda kumamisha uko vanhu vanogona kuzviendera vega vasarudza kudaro, pane zvekunovangorora ropa ravo mudzimba dzavo, nekuti izvi zvinogona kuita kuti vanhu vanga vasiingafanirwe kuziva chimiro chehutano hwemunhu vanopedzesera voziva, sezvamunozuiva, kana munhu angororwa ropa pane zvaunoita maringe nezvabuda mukuongorwa uku, akadaro Makonokaya.
"Macpherson Maulana, a journalist in Blantyre and a producer of radio programs on health, told VOA that government would do better to educate Malawians on the need for HIV testing so that people will go for tests on their own ""without being pushed."""	"Macpherson Maulana, mutori wenhau muBlantyre uye ari mugadziri hwezvirongwa zvehutano pawairesi, akaudza VOA kuti zviri nani kuti hurumende idzidzise vanhu vemuMalawi zvakakoshera kuongororwa ropa kuti munhu azive kuti ane denda remashuratongo here kana kuti kwete, kuitira kuti vanhu vagozviita vega ""vasina kusundwa nekumanikidzwa."""
I fear it could end up into fights. 	I fear it could end up into fights. You see it happened in Liberia recently where people who were coming to help people suspected to have contracted Ebola were even killed. So, civic education is the most important element for people to be encouraged to come out for testing voluntarily, said Maulana.

However, HIV/AIDS counselor David Odali, whose NGO Umunthu Foundation runs HIV-related projects, insisted privacy will be protected.

I think the first thing would be to provide group counseling to members of that family. 	Ndinofunga kuti chinhu chekutanga kupa dzidziso nemazano kuvanhu vemhuri iyi.
[Of course] people can be tested while others are watching, but when it comes to disclosing the results, a counselor is supposed to disclose that results to each and every individual separately, said Odali.

Water Crisis Raises Fears of Waterborne Disease in Malawi	Kushaikwa Kwemvura Kokonzera Kutyira Zvirwere Zvinaowanikwa Mumvura MuMalawi
Malawians in the country's commercial capital, Blantyre, usually rely on tap water.	Vanhu veBlantyre, guta guru pane zvehupfumi muMalawi, vanowanzoshandisa mvura inobuda mupombi.
But for the past five months, the taps have often run dry, forcing residents to draw water from unprotected sources like rivers and wells, while work is being done at the city main pumping station.	Asi kwemwedzi mishanu yadarika mapombi aya angaoma kuti papata, izvo zviri kumanikidza vagari kuti vachere mvura kubva munzvimbo dzisina kuchengetedzeka zvakaita senzizi yematsime, vakamirira kuti basa rekugadzirisa mishina inopomba mvura muguta iri.
The risk of contracting water-borne diseases is rising.	Njodzi yekubata zvirwere zvinogara mumvura iri kuramba ichisimuka.
In Blantyre and surrounding areas, residents have spent five days without tap water.	MuBlantyre nenzvimbo dzakaipoteredza, vagari vakagara mazuva mashanu vasina mvura inobuda mupombi.
Women, who by Malawi tradition are responsible for household tasks, complain of the risks they face when fetching water from rivers far from residential areas.	Madzimayi, avo maringe netsika yemuMalawi vanoita mabasa epamba, vanogun'una pamusoro penjodzi dzavanosangana nadzo pavanochera mvura kubva munzizi dziri munzvimbo dzinogara vanhu.
Rhoda Milanzi, a housewife and mother of three, tells VOA the journeys through bushy footpaths are risky. 	Rhoda Milanzi, mudzimayi anogara pamba vari mai vevana vatatu, vsnoudza VOA kuti zhiras dzekupfuura nemuzvikwenzi dzine njodzi.
"""We wake up every day 2 a.m., sometimes 1 a.m., to go and collect water. "	"""Tinomuka pakati pehusiku, nguva dzeku 2 a.m., dzimwe nguva kuma 1 a.m., kuti tiende kunochera mvura."
There are so many risks. 	Kune njodzi dzakawanda.
"You see, sometimes we would meet witches, snakes on the way,"" she says, ""even hyenas have been chasing us."""	"Unoona, dzimwe nguva taisanga nevaroyi, nenyoka muzhira,"" anodaro, ""kunyangwe mapere anotitandanisa."""
Milanzi says to ease the burden of carrying water home for bathing, women prefer to bathe in the river. 	Milanzi anoti kuti zvisanyanye kuvaremera kusenga mvura yakawanda yekugeza, madzimayi avakusarudza kugeza murwizi.
But she says they have been disturbed by youths who hide in the nearby bush.	Asi anoti vanokanganiswa nevechidiki vanenge vakahwanda muzvikwenzi zviri pedyo.
These youths of today would come there and hide somewhere to see us naked.	Vechidiki vanhasi ava vaiuya ipapo vagohwandira kuti vatione takashama.
This has been a major embarrassment.	Changa chiri chinyadzo chikuru.
In fact we complained to the chiefs about it. 	Takatozonogunun'una kumadzimambo pamusoro penyaya iyi.
They punished some of them, but you know they would sometimes climb trees just to look at older women like us taking a bath, she explains.	Vakaranga vamwe vavo, asi unozviva, dzimwe nguva vaikwira mumiti kuti vangoona madzimayi makuru akaita sesu tichigeza, anotsanangura achidaro.
The water problem also has affected the delivery of health services.	Dambudziko remvura iri rakabva rakanganisa kuwanikwa kwezvehurano.
Three weeks ago, authorities at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre confirmed that they had suspended surgical operations due to water scarcity.	Masvondo matatu apfuura, vakuru vepachipatara cheQueen Elizabeth Central Hospital muBlantyre vakabvuma kuti vakange vamisa kurapa kunosanganisira kucheka nekuvhura mitezo yemiviri yevanhu nekuda kwekushaikwa kwemvura.
Health rights campaigners warn of the possible outbreak of waterborne diseases, especially in densely populated areas, if the situation is left unresolved.	Vanorwira kodzero dzezvehutano vanoyambira kuti panogona kutushuka zvirwere zvinogara mumvura, zvikuru munzvimbo dzinogara vanhu vakawnda, kana nyaya iyi ikasagadziriswa.
Officials at the Blantyre Water Board attribute the problem largely to an ongoing European Union-funded project that seeks to install new pumping machines at Walkers Ferry, the main pumping station.

Priscilla Mateyu, the spokesperson for the Blantyre Water Board, says the project is expected to increase water production capacity to 105,000 cubic meters per day from the current daily production of 78,000 cubic meters.	Priscilla Mateyu, mutauriri weBlantyre Water Board, anoti basa iri riri kutarisirwa kuwedzera mvura inopombwa kuti isvike kuzviuru zana nezvishanu zvema cubic meters pazuva kubva pa cubic metre zviuru makumi manomwe nemaserenari kupombwa pazuva iyezvino.
January is when the project is finishing. 	Ndira ndipo pari kupera basa iri.
But for the new machines and everything else to start working properly, we have to wait until March [2015]. 	Asi kuitira mishina mitsva nezvimwe zvese kuti zvinyatsoshanda zvakanaka, tinotofanira kumiririra kusvikira Kukadzi wa2015.
That's when we expect the levels would increase and also production capacity improving to least what we expect it to be, Mateyu said.

The local consumer rights watchdog, the Consumers Association of Malawi, had been planning to hold vigils at the water board until the water supply was normalized, but the board asked protesters to hold off, promising to distribute water to residents through mobile water tanks. 	Sangano rinorwira kodzero dzevatengi muMalawi reConsumers Association of Malawi, rakange ricironga kuita mapungwe pamahofisi ebazi rinoona nezvemvura kusvikira nyaya yemvura yagadziriswa uye mvura yavakubuda mumapombi, asi bazi iri rakati vaida kuratidzira vambomira izvozvo, ndokubva vavimbisa kuunza mvura kuvagari vachishandisa matangi anotendera nemvura.
The consumer rights group has given the water board two weeks to fulfill its commitment before proceeding with the protests.	Sangano iri rakapa bazi rezvemvura kuti rizadzikise chivimbiso charo pasati pava nekuratidzira.
Malawi President Under Fire for Giving Money to Journalists	Mutungamiriri weMalawi Opinda Mumoto Nekupa Vatapi Venhau Mari
Malawi President Peter Mutharika is under fire for giving envelopes containing $125 to more than 80 media people at a dinner he hosted last month in Blantyre.

The editor of the privately owned Times Television said reporters were told the envelopes contained the presidents plans for the media - which has been critical of the governments economic performance.	Mupepeti wesangano renhau risiri rehurumende rinonzi Times Television akati vatapi venhau vakaudzwa kuti hamvuropu idzi dzaive nehurongwa hwemutungamiriri wenyika pamusoro pamasangano enhau, ayo anga achitsoropodza zvirikuitwa nehurumende mune zvehupfumi hwenyika.
In his column published in Malawis Sunday Times newspaper, editor Grecian Tukula said he was not sure why the money was given to journalists at the state dinner.	Muchinyorwa chake chakaburitswa mubepanhau remuMalawi rinonzi Sunday, mupepeti Grecian Tukula akati akange asina chokwadi chekuti seyi mari iyi yakapihwa vapepeti venhau pamabiko ehurumende aya.
"Tukula said he initially decided to return the money but reversed the decision to avoid ""creating a scene."""	"Tukula akati akange asarudza kudzorera mari iyi asi ndokuzoshandura pfungwa iyi kuti ""asakonzere bopoto."""
But the editor for the Weekend Nation newspaper, George Kasakula, told VOA that he returned the money right away.	Asi mupepeti webepanhau rinonzi Weekend Nation, George Kasakula, akaudza VOA kuti akabva adzorera mari iyi ipapo.
I just felt it was not right for me to receive the money, so I returned it. 	Ndakangonzwa mandiri kuti zvakange zvisina kunaka kuti nditambire mari iyi, saka ndakabva ndaidzorera.
My understanding is that if someone invites me to a workshop, its their duty to ensure that they feed me, they accommodate me and they transport me. 	 Kunzwisisa kwandiinako ndekwekuti kana munhu akandikoka kumusangano uri maringe nebasa ravanoita, ibasa ravo kuona kuti vandipa zvekudya, vondipa pekugara nezvekufambisa.
But in this case, I didnt see why I should get that allowance because I didnt spend anything to go to Sanjika [Palace], said Kasakula.	Asi pachiitiko ichi, handina kuona kuti sei ndaifanirwa kupihwa mari iyi nekuti handina chandakashandisa kuti ndiende kumuzinda wemutungamiriri,wenyia, unonzi Sanjika Palace, akadaro Kasakula.
The issue has attracted more public attention after privately owned Capital Radio aired a story questioning the meaning of the cash handouts from the president.	Nyaya iyi yakwezvawo vanhu veruzhinji mushure mekunge wayiresi isiri mumaoko ehurumende inonzi Capital Radio yakatepfenyura nyaya yaibvunza chirevo chekupa musvo wemari kwakaitwa uku ichibva kumutungamiriri wenyika.

This issue has been all over the social media, and even we as a media are implicated [we believe] it is paramount that we follow up and get to the bottom of the matter, said Steven Dakalira, the head of news and current affairs at Capital Radio.

In his column in the Nyasa Times, Malawi professor of law Danwood Mzikenge Chirwa said what President Mutharika did by giving money handouts to journalists at a news event was tantamount to bribery.

"Local civil society groups said that ""by attempting to bribe the journalists"" Mutharika subjected his leadership style to disrepute."	"Masangano anorwira kodzero dzevanhu dzakati ""nekuti vakaedza kupa fufuro kuvatapi venhau"" vaMutharika vakabva vaderedza kuhutungamiriri hwavo kuti humhurwe."
Meanwhile, some journalists are donating the money to charity.	Zvichakadayi, vamwe vatapi venhau varikupa mari iyi kuti ibatsire vanotambura nekushaiwa.
Brian Ligomeka, the Managing Editor for the Times Group, told Times Television that all four employees there have donated the money to an orphanage.

At first we decided to return the money to the president but we later thought it wise to buy assorted items like sugar, salt, notebooks and donate it to needy children, said Ligomeka.

Tenthani has since donated the money for charity work and said that although the journalists could have done better if they returned the money right away, doing so would have been perceived as disrespect to the head of state.	Tenthani akazopa mari iyi kuti ibatsire vanoshaya, uye akati kunyangwe hazvo vatapi venhau vaizenge vakaita zviri nani  deno kuri kunzi vakabva vadzorera mari iyi ipapo, kuita zvakadaro zvinga dai zvakaonekwa sekusaremekedza mukuru wenyika.

Kanyangwa said he feels many journalists failed to return the money immediately because they might have been out of their ethical senses when they got the money.

Strike Paralyzes Malawi's Judicial Services	Kuramwa Basa Kwevashandi kunogarisa pasi mabasa ezvemutemo muMalawi
A week-long strike by the support staff of Malawi's judiciary system has paralyzed the courts, causing overcrowding in police cells and the indefinite suspension of major cases - including government corruption trials. 	Kuramwa basa kwesvondo rose nevashandi vanotsigira bazi rezvemutemo muMalawi kwagarisa pasi matare edzimhosva, zvakonzera kuzarisa kwemastokisi anochengeterwa vabatwa pamalamba emapurisa uye nekumiswa pasina anoziva kuti kusvikira rinhi kwekutongwa kwenyaya hombe,- kusanganisira kutongwa kwevashandi vehurumende munyaya dzehuori.
Court marshals, clerks and messengers are demanding the 30 percent salary increases promised by the government two years ago.	Vanochengetedza hurongwa pamatare edzimhosva, vanyori nezvikonzi vari kuda kuwedzerwa kwemihoro yavo nezvikamu makumi matatu kubva muzana pamari yavari kutambira ikezvino sekuvumbisa kwehurumende makore maviri akadarika.
Chanting and singing around the court premises has become a pastime activity for the striking court workers since the onset of a sit-in last week.  	Kudanhidzira nekuimba pazvivanze zvematare edzimhosva ndizvo zvava kuvaraidza vashandi vari kuramwa mabasa ava kubva pakatanga chirongwa chekuuya kubasa asi vasingashande svondo rakapera.
Linley Hebert, a spokesperson for the striking workers, told VOA the strike is a result of the governments failure to honor a 2012 agreement.	 Linley Hebert, mutauriri wevashandi vari kuramwa mabasa ava, akaudza VOA kuti kuramwa mabasa uku kuri kubva pakukonewa kwehurumende kuzadzikisa zvayakawirorana nevashandi vayo muna 2012.
In October [this year], the government reviewed the salaries of the civil servants, but we were not included in that revision, Hebert said.	Muna Gumiguru gore rino, hurumende yakasimudzira mihoro yevashandi vehurumende, asi isu hatina iswawo pakati pevakawedzerwa mihoro yavo, Hebert akadaro.
Yet in 2012, we had an agreement that each time they are revising the salaries of the civil servants, [they will be increasing our salaries as well]. 	Asi muna 2012, takaita chibvumirano chekuti nguva yese pavawedzera mihoro yevashandi vehurumende, vanobva vawedzerawo neyedu mihoro.
So, [after adhering to the agreement in 2013], we are surprised to see that this time we are left out.  	Saka (mushure mekuzembera nekuremekedza chibvumirano chemuna 2013), tiri kushamiswa kuona kuti rwendo rwuno takabva tasiiwa tiri kunze.
Government authorities say the failure to increase judicial workers salaries this year is largely because of financial constraints, following a donor aid freeze against Malawi's government.	Vakuru vehurumende vanoti kukonewa kuwedzera mari dzemihoro dvevashandi vemubazi rezvemutemo gore rino zvakanyanyokonzerwa nekuoma pane zvemari, mushure mekumiswa kwemari yaibva kumasangano anobatsira ichipihwa hurumende yeMalawi.
The freeze is a result of a government financial scandal in which more than $30 million was looted from government coffers.  	Kumiswa kwekuwedzerwa kwemari uku kuri kubva pahuori hwezvemari umo mari inodarika mamiriyoni makumi matatu yakamoorwa kubva muhomwe dzehurumende
Ministry of Finance spokesperson Nations Msowoya told a local radio station it is hard for the government to meet the workers' demand.	Mutariri webazi rezvehupfumi, Nations Msowoya akaudza nhepfenyuro yemunharaunda kuti zvakaomera hurumede kuti izadzikise zviri kudiwa nevashandi vayo.
It is difficult to promise what the treasury will do. 	Zvakaoma kuvimbisa kuti vabati vechikwama chehurumende vachaita chii.
"But suffice to say that the prevailing economic circumstances and budgetary constraints will make a little bit difficult for the treasury to bow down to the demands, ""Msowoya said."	"Asi regai ndingoti mamiriro ezvehupfumi nekusomeka kwemari yekushandisa yehurumende zvichaita kuti  zviite sekugozhera vabati vechikwama chehurumende kuti vaite zviri kudiwa nevashandi, ""Msowoya akadaro."
But according to Hebert, the strikers will not resume work until their demands are met. 	Asi nemaonero aHebert, vashandi ava havasi kuzodzokera kubasa kusvikira zvavari kuda zvadzikiswa.
"""Since I was born [there has been] no time the government said it had some money."	"""Kubva zvandakazvarwa hapana nguva yekuti hurumende yaiti ine mari""."
"It has its own means [of finding the money] and it will find the same means to give us the money,"" Hebert insisted."	Ine nzira yayo (yekuwana mari iyi) uye ichawana nzira yekutipa mari iyi, Herbert akasimbirira kudaro.
The ongoing strike is hampering progress of trials, as court operations remain suspended.	Kuramwa mabasa kuri kuenderera mberi uku kuri kukanganisa kufambira mberi kwekutongwa kwenyaya, sezvo mabasa ematare edzimhosva akambomiswa kushanda.
Several trials, including that of former justice minister Ralph Kasambara, who is answering charges in connection with the financial scandal, were indefinitely suspended last week.	Kutongwa kwakawanda kwevanhu, kusanganisira kweuya akambove gurukota rezvemutemo, Ralph Kasambara, ari kupomerwa mhosva yekuva chikamu chehuori hwemari yakabiwa, kwakamiswa svondo rakapera pasina anoziva kuti kusvikira rinhi.
Police are complaining of congestion in jail cells, as no suspects are being taken to court.	Mapurisa ari kugunun'una kuti mastokisi mavanochengetra vanhu vari kunenedzerwa mhosva vasati vaenda kunotongwa makazarisa nekuti hapana vanhu vari kuendeswa kumatare.
"Malawi police spokesperson Rhoda Manjolo told VOA the only option they have is ""giving police bail to those with minor offenses.""  "	"Mutauriri wemapurisa emuMalawi Rhoda Manjolo akaudza VOA imwe nzira yavasara nayo ""ndeyekuti vanhu vae mhosva diki vatongwe vachibva kudzimba dzavo."""
Human rights campaigners and legal experts say the strike is contributing to human rights violations.	Vanorwira nekukurudzira kodzero dzevanhu nenyanzvi dzemutemo vanoti kuramwa mabasa uku kuri kuwedzera pakutyorwa kwemitemo yevanhu.
There are those people who have to be taken to court within 48 hours, noted Lawyer George Kadzipatike who works in a private practice in the northern city of Mzuzu.	Kune vanhu vanofanirwa kuendeswa kunotongwa kumatare edzimhisva maawa makumi mana nemasere asati adarika, rakadaro gweta, George Kadzipatike, rinoshanda mukambani yemagweta muguta rekumaodzanyenba enyika rinonzi Mzuzu.
"""We cannot make application for them to be granted bail."	"""Hatisi kugona kunyora tsamba tichivakumbirira kuti vatongwe vachibva kudzimba dzavo."
"There are those people who do not want to live with their partners, they would like the court to decree that they be divorced, we cannot file any petition through the courts."""	"Kune vaye vanhu vasisade kugara nevavakawanana navo, uye vari kuda kuti matare edzimhosva avati varambana zviri pamutemo, asi hatisi kugona kunyora chikumbiro chakadai kuburikidza nematare."""
Government authorities say closed door negotiations to resolve the matter continue in the capital, Lilongwe.	Vanhu vane zvigaro muhurumende vanoti nhaurirano dzemuchivande kuti nyaya iyi igadzirike dziri kuenderera mberi muguta guru, Lilongwe.
But the striking workers told VOA whatever the case, they will accept nothing short of a 30 percent increase in their salaries.	Asi vashandi vari kuramwa mabasa vakaudza VOA kuti kunyangwe zvikaendepi, havasi kuzogamuchira kuwedzerwa kwemihoro yavo kuri pasi pezvikamu makumi matatu kubva muzana.
A similar strike lasted three months in 2012 after the magistrates and judges joined the labor action.	Kuramwa mabasa kwakafanana nekuku kwaita mwedzi mitatu muna2012 mushure mekunge vatongi vematare epasi neepamusoro vose vapindawo mukuramwa mabasa uku.

Those convicted included a Catholic priest, Father Thomas Muhosa, police officer Chikondi Chileka, clinician Lumbani Kamanga, and the deceaseds brother, Cassim Masambuka.	Vakawanikwa vaine mhosva vanosanganisira fata wechechi yeRoma, Father Thomas Muhosa, mupurisa Chikondi Chileka, mushandi wepachipatara Lumbani Kamanga, uye nemukoma wemushakabvu, Cassim Masambuka.

Maringe nezvakataurwa nedare, Muhosha, Chileka nevamwe vakati vaigona kuita mhindu vachishandisa mitezo yakabviswa pachitunha chemunhu.
The judge said the state proved beyond reasonable doubt the 12 people conspired to kill Masambuka to extract his bones based on a perception they would benefit financially.	Mutongi akati vachuchuti vakaratidza humboo husina kupokana kuti vanhu gumi nevaviri ava vakarangana kuuraya Masambuka nekuzobvisa mapfupa ake kubva pamuviri wake vachifungidzira kuti vaizobatsirikana nekuwana mari.

Akati Masambuka ndiye munhu achangobva mukupondwa kuburikidza nekukuvadzwa zvakaipisisa kwevanhu vanorarama nehusope vanga vasiri kuchengetedzwa nekurwirwa nevanhu vagere munharaunda.
Director of Public Prosecutions Steve Kayuni represented the state in the case. 	Mukuru wevachuchuti Steve Kayuni ndiye akange akamiririra hurumende  mumhosva iyi.
He said he was pleased the court agreed on all the seven charges he presented.	Akati akafadzwa kuti dare rakatenderana naye pamhosva dzose dzaakatura kudare achiti ndidzo dzakange dzaparwa.
Its really something overwhelming on the part of the state considering that this matter, if you notice, there is a police officer involved, a priest involved and there is a brother involved.  	Chinhu chinobitirira kurutivi rwehurumende kuti kana ukazvitarisisa kuti munyayaya iyi muna fata arimo, mune muprisa arimowo uye muene mukoma wemushakabvu ari mukati mayo zvakare.
If you notice, it all revolves around the position of trust that somebody like the late Macdonald Masambuka trusted so much, they are the ones who ended up betraying him, Kayuni said.	Ukatarisisa, inotenderera pachinzvimbo chekuvimbwa zvekuti munhu akaita samushakabvu Macdonald Masambuka aivimba nevanhu ava zvekuti, ndivo vakazopedzesera vomurasisa nekumutengesa, Kayuni akadaro.
Masambuka went missing from his village on March 9, 2018, and his limbless body was found buried in a garden on April 2, 2018, in his home district of Machinga south of Malawi.	Masambuka akatanga kushaikwa kubva mumusha wake musi wa 9 Kurume, 2018, uye muviri wake wakange usisina maoko nemakumbo wakazowanikwa wakavigwa mubindu musi wa 2 Kubvumbi, 2018, mudunhu raaigara reMachinga kuchamhembe kweMalawi.

Kurunzirwa Mapepa emudare redzimhosva anoratidza kuti Masambuka akarunzirwa nemukoma wake kuti asangane neshamwari dzake, vaiti vakange vamuwanira musikana wekuti aroore.
But when they reached the scene, the alleged friends grabbed Masambuka by the neck and dragged him to a garden where they killed him. 	Asi pavasvika panzvimbo yakazoparwa mhosva, dziya dzainzi ishamwari dzakabva dzabata nechisimba Masambuka nepamutsipa, ndokumuzvuvira kubindu uko vakasvikomuurayira.
Here, his assailants cut off his limbs, burned his body using petrol and buried it there.	Ipapo, vapondi vake vakacheka maoko nemakumbo ake, ndokupisa muviri wake vachishandisa mafuta epeturu ndokumuviga ipapo.
This was the first such case involving high-profile community members involved in attacks on persons with albinism.	Iyi ndiyo nyaya yekutanga ine vanhu vanozivikanwa zvikuru munharaunda vachiwanikwa vari mukati mekuponda vanhu vanorarama nehusope.
Masauko Chamkakala, the lawyer for the 12 defendants in the case, said he would comment once he had gone through the judgment.	Masauko Chamkakala, gweta revapomerwi gumi nevaviri ava munyaya iyi rakati raizowana zvekutaura pamusoro penyaya iyi kana awana nguva yekurava mutongo uyu.
We are still waiting to see the perfected judgment so that we can read it and study it and talk to our clients, Chamkakala said.	Tichakamirira kuti tione chinyorwa chekutongwa chapepetwa kuti tichiverenge nekuchinzvera, tozotaura nevanhu vatanga tichimiririra munyaya iyi, Chamkakala akadaro.
Rights activists said they expected the court to give stiffer punishment to those convicted.	Vanhu vanorwira kodzero vakati vaitarisira dare kuti ripe mutongo unorwadza chose kuna avo vese vakawanikwa vaine mhosva.

Ian Simbota represented the Association of Persons with Albinism at the court.	Ian Simbota wakange akamirira musangano wevanhu vanorarama nehusope cheAssociation of Persons with Albinism padare.
When the judge was reading, what concerned me was that part of a [Priest] Father Muhosha [and others] who have been convicted of transacting body parts. 	Mutongi paanga achiverenga, chandibata chikamu chiya apo fata weRoma, Father Muhosha nevamwe vawanikwa vaine mhosva yekutengesa mitezo yemuviri wemunhu.
If you go to the Anatomy Act, it is not so hard on such offenses.	Kana ukanorava mutemo pamusoro pemitezo yemumuviri wemunhu, Anatomy Act, hazvina kuoma kuti uone nekunzwisisa kutyorwa kwemutemo pakadai.
So, we are really looking forward to the judge, if at all its possible, to put a human face to the case so that at least we really need to see serious sentencing on this case, Simbota said.

Civil Society Workers Run Afoul of Tanzania Security Officials in Sign of Increasing Clampdown	Vashandi Vemasangano Anorwira Kodzero Dzevanhu Vanonetswa Nevanoona Nezvekuchengetedzwa KweTanzania, Zvichiratidza Kuwedzerwa Kwekutsikira
African civil society campaigners attending a conference in Tanzania were questioned and warned over the weekend, in what human rights activists say is part of a continuing clampdown on free speech in the East African nation.	Varwiri dzekodzero dzevagari vemuAfrica vari kumusangano mukuru uri kuitirwa kuTanzania vakabvunzurudzwa vakayambirwa pakupera kwesvondo, muchiitiko chiri kunzi nevarwiri vekodzero dzevanhu chikamu chiri kuenderera mberi chekutsikirira pasi rusunguko rwekuti vanhu vanogona kutaura zvavanoda nekufunga vakasununguka.
Details are still emerging over what exactly happened to at least 40 civil society workers who ran afoul of security officials at this year's summit of the Southern African Development Community in Dar es Salaam.	Zvichiri kubuda zvishoma nezvishoma zvekuti chii chaizvo chakanyatsoitika kuvashandi vasiri pasi pemakumi mana vemasangano anorwira kodzero dzevagari vakanetsana nevashandi vanoona nezvekuchengetedzwa nerunyararo munyika pamusangano mukuru wemubatanidzwa dzenyika dzekuchamhembe kweAfrica unonzi Southern African Development Community wakaitirwa muDar es Salaam.
But rights experts said Monday that the episode is another worrying sign of heightened paranoia and harassment from the government.	Asi nyanzvi mune zvekodzero dzakati nemusi weMuvhuro kuti zvakaitika izvi chimwe chiratidzo chinoshungurudza chekuwedzerwa kwekutya mimvuri nechati kwatara nekumbunyikidzwa kuri kuitwa nehurumende.
Catherine Eden, a lawyer for the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition, says the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding. 	Catherine Eden, gweta remubatanidzwa wemasangano anorwira kodzero dzevanhu muTanzania, reTanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition, anoti zvakaitika izvi zvakabva pakusanzwisisana.
South African delegates to the 15-nation conference, she said, wanted to hold a short commemoration of the seventh anniversary of South Africa's deadly Marikana mine massacre on Aug. 16. 	Akati vakokwa vakange vabva kuSouth Africa kumusangano wenyika gumi neshanu uyu vakange vachida kuita muchinguva chipfupi chiitiko chekurangarira zvakaitika pakapfurwa vashandi vemumigodhi kuMarikana kuSouth Africa makore manomwe apfuura musi wa 16 Nyamavhuvhu.
Thirty-four striking miners were killed by police in the deadliest security incident since the end of apartheid in 1994.	Vashandi makumi matatu nevana vemumigodhi vakaurayiwa nemapurisa pachiitiko chisanganisira mapurisa chakaipisisa chisati chamboitika kubva pakapera kutonga kwehudzvanyiriri hwechichena mugore ra1994.
So delegates at a side event sang the South African anthem, held a moment of silence and availed on their government to better protect its people. 	Saka vakokwa vakange vari pachiitiko chaiitika necheparutivi vakaimba rwiyo rwenyika rwemuSouth Africa, ndokutora chinguva chekunyarara vachiyeuka nekuremekedza vashakabvu uye ndokuzokumbira hurumende yavo kuti idzivirire vanhu vayo nezhira dziri nani.
But something they wrote on a piece of paper convinced security police the delegates had bigger plans.	Asi chimwe chinhu chavakanyora pachipepa chakaita kuti mapurisa agutsikane kuti vakokwa ava vaive nehurongwa hwekuita zvimwe zvinhu zvikurusa.
"They wrote some messages on the flip charts, of which the little content that was captured in the flip charts read, 'Stop killing our people,' she said. ""... "	"Vakanyora mamwe mashoko pamapepa makuru, uye zvainge zvanyorwa pamazipepa aya zvaiti, ""Regai kuuraya vanhu vedu"" akadaro. ""..."
So I think there was a national security person in that meeting and he saw those messages and so he interpreted that as a plan to demonstrate. 	Saka ndinofunga kuti mumusangano uyu maive nemunhu anoona nezvekuchengetedzwa kwenyika, uye paakaona mashoko aya akabva afunga kuti hwaive hurongwa hwekuratidzira.
"But if you look closely, you can't see any relationship as to why they would want to demonstrate for the Marikana shootings in Tanzania."""	" Asi ukanyatsotarisisa, haugone kuona kuti sei vaizoda kuratidzira pamusoro pekupfurwa kwevanhu kuMarikana kuSouth Africa, asi ivo vari muTanzania."""
It's not clear if anyone was actually arrested. 	Hazvina kujeka kana panotori nemunhu akasungwa.
Other rights groups say that some foreign campaigners were arrested, but not interrogated.	Mamwe masangano ezvekodzero anoti zvizvarwa zvekune dzimwe nyika zvakasunga, asi hazvina kubvunzurudzwa.
Afraid, insecure'	Kutya, kunzwa kusachengetedzeka'
Eden says she was summoned by authorities as she went to the police station Friday night to meet with a local coordinator and then was let go with a warning. 	Eden anoti akasheedzwa kuzoona vakuru apo ayienda kukamba yemapurisa manheru eChishanu kunoona mumwe wevaronga ari chizvarwa chemuTanzania asi ndokuzonzi aende hake asi apihwa yambiro yekusazviita futi.
Police later went to delegates' hotel rooms looking for materials that they thought were a security threat. They found nothing, she said.	Mushure mazvo, mapurisa akazoenda mumipanda yemumahotera maigara vakokwa ava vachitsvaga zvinhu zvaifungidzira kuti zvinogona kukanganisa kuchengetedzeka kwenyika. Hapana chavakawana, akataura achidaro.
Janet Zhou, director of the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development, was one of the campaigners questioned by security forces at her hotel.	Janet Zhou, mukuru wesangano rinoona nezvehukama huri pakati pezvikwereti zveZimbabwe negoneso yekuunza kubudirira munyika yeZimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development, aive mumwe wevarwiri vekodzero vakabvunzurudzwa nemapurisa pahotera paaigara.
I was afraid, I was insecure, I was traumatized to say the least, she told VOA, after returning home to Harare. 	"Ndakange ndavakutya, ndainzwa kuti handina kuchengetedzeka, ndisingawanze mashoko ndakasiiwa ndizere kutya nekushungurudzwa mukati mangu, akaudza VOA, mushure mekudzoka kumusha ku Harare. ""Nekuti kuona vanhu vezvekuchengetedzwa kwenyika vachiuya nguva dzadarika pakati pehusiku, vachindibvunzurudza pamusoro pekuratidzira nezvinyorwa zviri pamapepa makuru andakange ndisingagone kuvapa, chaive chimwe chinhu chisionekwe. Handina kuzvihwisisa. Zvakandisiya ndichigwagwadza nekutya."

Despite Oil and Gas Reserves, Africa Feels Pressure of Rising Energy Costs	Kunyangwe Iine Hupfumi Hwemafuta Ekufambisa Nemweya Unocherwa Kubva Pasi (Gas) Zvisati Zvacherwa Kubva Pai, Africa Yogwabvurwa Nekukwira Kwemitengo yemafuta ekufambisa nemweya wekubikisa
Africans are feeling the pinch caused by soaring global energy prices, say analysts, even in countries like Nigeria and Angola that are major exporters of crude oil.

While that handful of oil producers is seeing an increase in revenue especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24 much of the continent lacks refining capability, forcing countries to pay high prices to import gasoline and other petroleum products from Asia and Europe.

With salaries largely stagnant, more than two-thirds of Africans feel pressured by the rising prices, said Franklin Cudjoe, founding president of the Ghana-based Imani Center for Policy and Education.

The continent is affected simply because we depend largely on global oil suppliers, since not many African countries have [their own] oil products, Cudjoe told VOA.

Prices spiked on the global oil market after the invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of international sanctions against Russia, one of the worlds leading exporters of crude.

In Ghana, for example, overall consumer price inflation was pegged at 15.7% year-on-year in February compared with 13.9% in January, the countrys Statistical Service said last week.

Cudjoe said it was crucial for governments and regional bodies such as the African Union to build defenses to cushion consumers in times of economic uncertainty.	Cudjoe akati zvakosha kuti hurumende nemasangano anoshanda mumatunhu akaita seMubatanidzwa weAfrica kana kuti African Union vavake zvinhu zvinodzivirira vatengi munguva yekusagadzikana pane zvehupfumi.
"Even if it means building defenses in terms of the provision of food, said Cudjoe, adding, ""I could imagine Nigeria, if it had had its way, it could be selling foodstuff to most countries at reduced rates by now."""	"Kunyangwe zvichireva kuvaka kudzivirira panyaya dzekupa vanhuzvekudya, akadaro Cudjoe, achitizve, ""Ndiri kuedza kufunga neNigeria, deno yaigona kuzviita nezhira iyi, ingadeyi yotengesera dzimwe nyika chikafu nemari yaderera ikezvino."""
There must be that urgency of building for themselves defenses, funds that would make us sustain ourselves -- at least to prevent us from being completely annihilated by these uncertainties in the world.

In a statement this week, President Emmerson Mnangagwas government said it wants its employees to resume meeting in person.  	Mumashoko akabuda iro svondo rino, hurumende yavaEmmerson Mnangagwa yakati inoda vashandi vayo kuti vachitanga kuuya kusangana kumabasa mbune.
Late Tuesday, Monica Mutsvangwa, the countrys information minister, said the number of people being hospitalized for COVID-19 is on a steady decline.

This indicates that the national response measures instituted by government continue to pay off.	Izvi zvinoratidza kuti matanho akatorwa nehurumene munyika yese akatangwa nehurumende ari kuburitsa zvibereko zvakanaka.
In view of the continued decline in new cases and deaths, coupled with a declining testing positivity rate that is indicating that the community transmission has gone down, all ports of entry [are to] be reopened, but ensuring that all the recommended COVID-19 prevention measures are adhered to, she said.

However, the compulsory vaccination rule is not being welcomed by all civil servants.	Zvisineyi, mutemo wekumakidza munhu wese kubaiwa majekiseni ekudzivirira hausi kutambirwa nevashandi vese vehurumende.
Obert Masaraure, the president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, says the workers will take the matter to court if the government insists.	Obert Masaraure, mutungamiriri wemusangano wevadzidzisi vekumaruwa weAmalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, anoti vashandi vachendesa nyaya iyi kumatatre kana hurumende ikasimbirira nayo.
A contract that was signed by civil servants has no provision for mandatory vaccination.  	Chibvumirano chakagamuchirwa nevashandi vehurumende chakanga chisina painzi vanomanikidzwa kubaiwa majekiseni ekudzivirira matenda mandatory vaccination.
So if the Public Service Commission wants to bar civil servants who are not vaccinated, they are in breach of contract and its unacceptable.	Saka kana bazi rezvevashandi vehurumende rePublic Service Commission richida kudzivisa vashandi vehurumende vasina kubaiwa majekiseni ekudzivirira denda, rinenge ravakutotyora chibvumirano chebasa, uye izvi hazvigamuchirike zvachose.

No one can be forced foreign substances to be inserted into their bodies, he noted.	Hapana anofanirwa kumanikidzwa kubaiwa zvinhu zvaasingazive mumiviri wavo, akataura avhidaro.
Dr. Norman Matara, the head of Zimbabwe Association for Doctors for Human Rights, says his organization has noted that several other countries are moving towards compulsory vaccination.	Dr. Norman Matara, mukuru wesangano raanachiremba vanorwira kodzero dzevanhu muZimbabwe, reZimbabwe Association for Doctors for Human Rights, vanoti sangano ravo riri kuona kuti nyika zhinji dzavakufamba dzakananga kwekumanikidzira vanhu vese kuti vabaiwe majekiseni ekudzivirira denda iri.
It is something that we are strongly against.	Chinhu chatinokwikwidzana nacho zvachose.
We think mandating vaccines is something that fuels vaccine hesitance.	Tinofunga kuti kumanikidzira kubaiwa kunowedzera kuti pazove nekusada kubaiwa.
There is a lot of conspiracy theory that goes around when people are saying we are being forced to be vaccinated. 	Pane nhema dzakawanda nezvirehwarehwa zvinozofambiswa kana vanhu vakati tiri kumanikidzwa kunzi tibaiwe majekiseni anodzivirira denda.
We really have to get the buy in of people: spread the gospel of vaccines, how they work and then encourage people to get vaccinated and not force them to get vaccinated, he pointed out.	Tinofanirwa kuwana kugamuchirwa nekufarirwa kwechirongwa ichi: kuparidza dama rakanaka remishonga inodzivirira denda, anoshanda sei, pedzezvo tozokurudzira vanhu kuti vabaiwe, kwete vekuita zvekumanikidza, akatsinhidzira achidaro.
But Sifiso Ndlovu from the Zimbabwe Teachers Association supports the governments position.	Asi vaSifiso Ndlovu vekuZimbabwe Teachers Association vanotsigira maonero nezviri kuitwa nehurumende.
Definitely, all workers should take up the vaccination.	Zvomene, vashandi vese vanofanirwa kubaiwa majekiseni ekudzivirira.
Not because they want to protect themselves, but they want to protect their colleagues at work. 	Kwete nekuti vanoda kuzvichengetedza, asi nekuti vanoda tochengetedza vanhu vavanoshanda navo kumabasa.
Scientific evidence has it that if you are fully vaccinated it comes with a mild attack. 	Humboo weruzivo rwemazuvano rwesainzi rwunoti kana wakabaiwa majekiseni ekudzivirira ese denda iri rinokurwisa asi risina simba nehukasha zvachose.
Why not take up that? There is nothing wrong or sinister about it, he said.	Saka tingagorambireyi kubaiwa? Hapana chakaipa kana chisinganzwisisike pamusoro pazvo, vakadaro.
About 3.3 million people in Zimbabwe have received two shots of the COVID-19 vaccines, while about 86,000 have received a third jab.

"Russia yange ichiita basa ""zvikuru sei munzvimbo dzaisivikanwa sekuti dzinorunzirwa neFrance"" munyika dzaive pasi pehutongi hweFrance dzakaita seCAR neMali, akadaro Djallil Lounnas, munzveri anoshanda ari pachikoro chepamusoro soro muMorocco cheAl Akhawayn university."
"While military contractors sometimes shepherd Russian arms sales, the revenue ""really pales compared with the profit they are able to generate from mining concessions and access to natural resources,"" Doxsee said."	"Kunyangwe hazvo makambani echiuto akazvimiririra aya dzimwe nguva achifambisa kutengeswa kwezvombo zvinogadzirwa neRussia ""mari inopinda apa haina chainoreva kana ichizoenzaniswa nemari svinu yavanogona kuburitsa kubva pamvumo pakuchera migodhi kana kodzero yekushandisa zviwanikwa zvinokosha munyika,"" Doxsee akadaro."
That makes unstable countries with mineral or hydrocarbon wealth prime customers such as in Syria where the mercenaries first became known to the wider public.	Izvi zvinoita kuti nyika dzisina kugadzika asi dziine zvicherwa kana hupfumi hwemafuta dzive nyika dzine hufpimi dzingada kuitirwa basa nemauto aya, sekuSyria uko vakrwi ava vakange vozivikanwa nevanhuwo zvavo eruzhinji rwemunyika.
No questions asked	Hapana mibvunzo inobunzwa
Lounnas said that another advantage for clients is a lack of friction over human rights and democracy that might come with Western partners.	Lounnas akati chimwe chakanakira vanoitirwa basa ndechekusazonetsana panyaya dzekodzero dzevanhu negutsaruzhinji zvinogona kuuya nemakambani anobva kunyika dzekumavirira.
Russia has its interests. It doesn't ask questions, he added.	Russia ine zvainodawo. Haibvunze mibvunzo, akapamhidzira achidaro.
Reports of violence and abuse on the ground suggest that same latitude may extend to the mercenaries themselves.	Kutaurwa kwehutsinye nechisimba chinokuvadza nekubatwa zvisina kunaka kwevanhu kunopa pfungwa yekuti kuda izvi ndizvowo zvinoitwa kuvarwi vemakambani akazvimiririra pachezvavo.
In the CAR, the United Nations is probing an alleged massacre during a joint operation by government forces and Wagner fighters.	MuCAR, United Nations iri kuferefeta kuurayiwa kwevanhu vazhinji panguva imwe chete pabasa remubatanidzwa wemauto vehurumende nevarwi veWagner.
"One military source told AFP that more than 50 people died, some in ""summary executions."""	"Mumwe munhu ari muchiuto akaudza AFP kuti vanhu vanodarika makumi mashanu vakafa, vamwe ""vachifa vachiitwa zvekupfurwa nepfuti."""
On Thursday, the European Union said it would not resume military training in the CAR suspended since mid-December unless the country's soldiers stop working for Wagner.	"Nemusi weChina, sangano reEuropean Union yakati yakange isiri kuzosimudzira kudzidziswa kwezvechiuto CAR ”izvo zvakange zvambomiswa pakati paZvita ""kusvikira mauto emunyika umu arega kushandira Wagner."""
Meanwhile the mercenaries' results do not always measure up to the hopes of the governments that hire them.	Zvichakadai zvinoitwa nezvikwata zvemauto ekunze aya hazviwanzoenderana nezvinenge zvichitarisirwa nehurumende dzinenge dzavapa mabasa ekuita.
In Libya, Russian mercenaries suffered heavy losses in Marshal Khalifa Haftar's year-long attempt to conquer the capital Tripoli, which was ultimately unsuccessful.	MuLibya, varwi vemakambani echiuto akazvimiririra ekuRussia akarasakirwa nehupenyu nezvishandiswa mukuedza kwegore rose kwaMarshal Khalifa Haftar kuti akunde nekutora guta guru reTripoli, chakazova chinhu chisina kuzobudirira pakupedzesera.
And in Mozambique, the Russians retreated in the face of Islamic State group jihadists, ultimately losing out to South African competitors.	Uye muMozambique, varwi vekuRussia ava vakadududza vatarisana nevarwi vechi ihad veboka reIslamic State group jihadists, vachibva vatorerwa basa nevanovakwikwidza nekuSouth Africa.
"Although lacking language skills and experience with the terrain, Wagner ""were picked because they were the cheapest"", Doxsee said."	"Kunyangwe vasingagone mutauro wemunyika kana kunzwisisa mamiririro akaita nzvimbo yavanoshandira, mauto eWagner ""akasarudzwa nekuti ndivo vakange vaine mari yakanyanya kuderera kudarika vamwe vose"", akadaro Doxsee."
"They didn't have what it took to succeed, she added, noting that ""they've had a fair few failures"" across Africa."	"Vakange vasina zvinoita kuti vabudirire, akawedzera achidaro, achitiwo ""vakasangana nekukonewa kwati wandeyi"" muAfrica yose."

Cyclone Batsirai Weakens After Hitting Madagascar, Floods Feared	Dutu Rinonzi Batsirai Rinopera Simba Mushure Mekurova, Mashamu Otyirwa
Cyclone Batsirai weakened overnight but floods were still expected due to heavy rain after it hit eastern Madagascar with strong winds, the island's meteorological office said Sunday.

Batsirai has weakened, Meteo Madagascar said, adding that the cyclone's average wind speed had almost halved to 80 kph, while the strongest gusts had scaled back to 110 kph from the 235 kph recorded when it made landfall on Saturday evening.	Batsirai yaderea simba rayo, Meteo Madagascar yakadaro, asi ndokuzotiwo kumhanya kwedutu iri kwakange kwadupuka zvekugurwa nepakati ravakufamba mutunhu wemamaira makumimasere muawa rimwe chete, uyewo mhepo yakange yadzikira kusvika pakufamba mutunhu wezana negumi remamaira muawa rimwechete kubva pamamaira mazana mairi nemakumi matatu nemashanu paawa akaonekwa dutu parakamhara muchitsuwa ichi nemusi weMugovera manheru.
The cyclone, the second storm to hit the large Indian Ocean island nation in just a few weeks, was moving westwards at a rate of 19 kph, the meteorological services said.

"But ""localized or generalized floods are still feared following the heavy rains,"" it said, adding that Batsirai should emerge at sea in the Mozambique Channel later Sunday."	"Asi ""madutu anenge ari epanzvimbo imwe chete kana anenge akapararira munzvimbo dzakasiyana siya"" anowanzotyirwa kuti anoitika mushure kwekunaya kwemvura zhinji"" yakadaro ichitiwo Batirai yaigona kuzotangawo munyanza muchikamu chakatarisana nenyika yemozambique chinonzi Mozambique Channel zuva roda kurereka nemusi weSvondo."
Batsirai made landfall in Mananjary district, more than 530 kilometers southeast of the capital Antananarivo, around 8 p.m. local time (1700 GMT) Saturday.

"It reached the island as an ""intense tropical cyclone"", packing winds of 165 kph, Faly Aritiana Fabien of the country's disaster management agency told AFP."	"Rakange rasvika muchitsuwa ""sedutu rakasimba"" riine mhepo dzaimhanya zvekusvika muawa rimwe chete kumatunhu ari kure zvemamaira zana nemakumi matanhatu ane mashanu, Faly Aritiana Fabien uyu anoshanda pasi bebazi rinoona nezvekunatsira munguva dzetsaona nenjodzi munyika akaudza AFP."

Just an hour and a half after it first hit land, nearly 27,000 people had been counted as displaced from their homes, Fabien said.

"The Meteo-France weather service had earlier predicted Batsirai would present ""a very serious threat"" to Madagascar, after passing Mauritius and drenching the French island of La Reunion with torrential rain for two days."	"Sangano rinoongorora mamiriro ekunze rekuFrance reMeteo-France rakange rafanotaura kuti raitarisira kuti Batsirai raizounza ""njodzi huru"" kuMadagascar, mushure mekupfuura nemuMauritius uye nekupura nemubvumbi chitsuwa chiri pasi peFrance chinonzi La Reunion kwemazuva maviri."
In the hours before the cyclone hit, residents hunkered down in the impoverished country, still recovering from the deadly Tropical Storm Ana late last month.

Zimbabwe Court Orders Trial for NY Times Freelancer	Dare Redzimhosva MuZimbabwe Rinorayira Kutongwa Kwetapi Wenhau Anombonyorera NY Times
A court in Zimbabwe dismissed a discharge application Tuesday in a case against a New York Times journalist. Freelance journalist Jeffrey Moyo is accused of flouting Zimbabwe's immigration laws when he allegedly helped two foreign reporters enter the southern African nation illegally last year.	Rimwe dare redzimhosva muZimbabwe rakandira kunze chikumbiro chesatongwa chakaitwa neChipiri munyaya yemhosva iri kunenedzerwa mumwe mutapi wenhau weNew York Times. Mutapi wenhau anonyorera masangano enhau akasiyana siyana, journalist Jeffrey Moyo ari kupomerwa mhosva yekutyora mitemo yekupinda nekubuda kwevanhu muZimbabwe apo achinzi akabatsira vatapi venhau vekune dzimwe nyika vaviri kuti vapinde munyika iyi iri kuchamhembe kweAfrica zviri kunze kwemutemo gore rakapera.
Kathleen Mpofu one of Moyo's lawyers said the journalist will go on trial April 28.	Kathleen Mpofu mumwe wemagweta aMoyo akati mutapi wenhau uyu achamira pamberi pedare kuti atongwe musi wa28 Kubvumbi.
The magistrate dismissed the application. He basically found that the state had led enough evidence for Mr. Moyo to be put to his defense and coming to this finding, Mpofu told VOA from Bulawayo, via WhatsApp.	Mutongi wedare redzimhosva akaramba kugamuchira chikumbiro chekusatongwa. Akaona kuti vachuchusi vehurumende vakane vaunza humboo hwakakwana zvekuti vaMoyo vanofanirwa kuzvidavirira, uye pakusvika pavakaona izvi, Mpofu akaudza VOA ari kuBulawayo, achishandisa WhatsApp.
It seems the magistrate relied on the fact that the state had led the evidence of the allegedly false accreditation cards that had been obtained by the foreign journalist and based on his interpretation of the evidence led by the state, he found that it was sufficient to put the accused to his defense.	Zvinoita sekuti mutongi akashandisa zvekuti vachuchusi vehurumende vakange vatungamidza mberi zvinonzi zvitupa zvekuita basa zvisiri zvechokwadi zvakange zvawanikwa nemutapi wekunze kwenyika, uye achishandisa kunzwisisa kwake kwehumboo hwakaturwa nevachuchusi vehurumende, akaona zvakakwana kuti nyakupomerwa mhosva azvidavirire zvaari kupomerwa.
Moyo's lawyers believed the case might be dismissed, after the same court earlier this month acquitted a Zimbabwe Media Commission official, Thabang Manhika, for allegedly processing fake accreditations for two South Africa-based New York Times journalists who entered Zimbabwe and were later deported. Moyo and Manhika were being tried separately.	Magweta aMoyo vaivimba kuti nyaya iyi yazokandwa kunze kwedare, mushure medare rimwe chete rati mumwe mushandi weZimbabwe Media Commission official, Thabang Manhika, akange asina mhosva yekugadzira zvitupa zvenhema zvekupa vatapi venhau vaviri vekuSouth Africa vanoshandira New York Times vakange vapinda muZimbabwe asi mushure kwava kuzodzingwa munyika. Moyo naManhika vakange vachitongwa vakapatsanurwa, mumuwe nemumwe sedungamunhu.
Zimbabwe's government says both Moyo and Manhika broke immigration laws.	Hurumende yeZimbabwe inoti vese Moyo naManhika vakatyora mitemo yekupinda nekubuda kwevanhu.
Information Ministry Permanent Secretary Ndabaningi Nick Mangwana commented on Tuesday's ruling.	Munyori mukuru mubazi rekufambiswa kwemashoko Ndabaningi Nick Mangwana akataura pamusoro pemutongo wakaitwa neChipiri uyu.
We just want to see that there's law and order. 	Taingoda kuona kuti pane mutemo nekugadzikana kwezvinhu.
If somebody has committed a crime or is perceived, they will have their day in court, so he is having his day in court, so his outcome is not in our hands, it's in the hands of the criminal justice system.	Kana mumwe mnhu akapara mhosva kana kuti ari kuonekwa seakapara mhisva, vachawana zuva ravo rekuzvidavirira mudare redzimhosva, saka awana zuva rake mudare redzimhosva, saka zvichaitika kwaari hazvisi mumaoko edu, zviri mumaoka ehurongwa hwemitemo inotonga nekururamisa panenge patyorwa mutemo.
That's our position, Mangwana said.	Ndiwo maonero edu, Mangwana akadaro.
Tabani Moyo of the Media Institute of Southern Africa, or MISA, has called for the journalist to be treated fairly.	Tabani Moyo wesangano rezvenhau rekuchamhembe kweAfrica reMedia Institute of Southern Africa, kana kuti MISA, akati mutapi wenhau uyu anofanirwa kutongwa nenzira yekururamisira pasi divi rinotorwa nevatongi.
MISA Zimbabwe underscores the need for fair trial. 	MISA Zimbabwe inosimbisa kuti panofanirwa kuva nekutonga kwekuyenzanisira.
That is our position throughout till the end of the case. 	Ndiwo maonero edu kusvikira nyaya iyi yapera.
