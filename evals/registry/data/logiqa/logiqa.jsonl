This unique light emitted by atoms is also affected by the mass of the elementary particles that make up the atoms, especially electrons. If the mass of an atom increases, the energy of the photons released by it will also become higher, so the frequency of release and absorption will be blue-shifted. On the contrary, if the particles become lighter and lighter, the frequency will redshift.

This unique light emitted by atoms is also affected by the mass of the elementary particles that make up the atoms, especially electrons. If the mass of an atom increases, the energy of the photons released by it will also become higher, so the frequency of release and absorption will be blue-shifted. On the contrary, if the particles become lighter and lighter, the frequency will redshift.
