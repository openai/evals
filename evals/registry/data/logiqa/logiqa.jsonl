The idea is that at high speeds, the plane's deformed wings are tucked back slightly to reduce drag and turbulence. As the plane slows down, the wings automatically extend forward to help it land faster and more smoothly. But deforming a wing is no easy task. The key is to create a deformable wing using special smart materials that flex and stretch automatically when exposed to external air pressure and stimulation. Among them, the wing material made of memory alloy can make the airplane wing change into a special shape in a certain air environment; Another important smart material is piezoelectric ceramics, which can respond sensitively to changes in voltage, temperature and other environmental factors. Scientists say such planes with flexible wings are at least 20 years away.
