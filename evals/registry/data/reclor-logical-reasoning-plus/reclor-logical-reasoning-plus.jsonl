The attribute that most Internet crimes have in common is anonymity. Criminals hide behind screen names when perpetrating their crimes and feel safe from apprehension and punishment in doing so because other Internet users cannot learn their true identities, and jurisdictional and budget issues make it difficult for law enforcement agencies to enforce existing laws. Clearly, the only way to reduce such crime in the future is to create a system that requires Internet users to provide their true identities and full contact information in a way that is visible to all other users. Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to which of the following? \nA. A. When surveyed in prison, the majority of convicted violent criminals report that they have made decisions during their criminal careers to avoid at least one potential victim because of fears that the potential victim might be armed. Even when the criminals themselves are armed, they tend to prefer unarmed victims. Add to this the fact that statistics reveal that complete bans on private weapons in some jurisdictions have failed to eliminate violent crime and the fact that many jurisdictions with a high proportion of private weapon ownership enjoy a very low crime rate, and one may conclude that public policy should favor the private ownership of weapons. \nB. B. Crimes involving deception are on the increase at the same time that crimes of violence seem to be decreasing. Law enforcement techniques in the past have focused primarily on the prevention and detection of violent crime. However, it is now clear that new techniques are required to combat crimes such as Internet fraud. Law enforcement agencies will have to focus on recruiting, hiring, and training a larger proportion of computer literate officers if they hope to keep up with modern criminals. \nC. C.

Specially trained officers often raid illicit breeding operations and seize proscribed animals such as chimpanzees and tigers. Although these species are capable of becoming dangerous, individuals are still drawn to them as pets. The fact that their possession is unlawful is an inadequate deterrent.

On the basis that there are nine planets in our solar system and one of them has life as we know it, the astronomer predicted that there are as many as one million extraterrestrial civilizations across all solar systems.

These legislators argue that <b> such a policy would reduce crime dramatically </b>, since it would take people with a proven tendency to commit crimes off the streets permanently. What this reasoning overlooks, however, is that people old enough to have served two prison sentences for serious crimes rarely commit more than one subsequent crime. <b> Filling our prisons with such individuals would have exactly the opposite of the desired effect, </b> since it would limit our ability to incarcerate younger criminals, who commit a far greater proportion of serious crimes.

Volunteering is often described as doing good works to improve the lives of others. How good to know that there is evidence that it can equally benefit your own well-being! Question: The inference drawn above is unwarranted because \nA. A. None of the other options are correct. \nB. B. growing older might not necessarily result in a change in mental outlook \nC. C. some of those who do not volunteer might be older than some volunteers and so could not be considered their peers \nD.
