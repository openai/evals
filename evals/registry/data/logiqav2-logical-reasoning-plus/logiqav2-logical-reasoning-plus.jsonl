Emotional intelligence classes are popular among parents. Emotional intelligence is the ability to control and manage emotions, and it plays an important role in people's life and work. However, in the hearts of many people, the connotation of emotional intelligence has been alienated.

In the deep space of more than 20,000 kilometers, a brand new navigation system is needed. Astronomers have proposed several possible navigation systems, and the most talked about is pulsar navigation. Pulsars are a kind of neutron stars whose magnetic pole direction can produce radio or X-ray radiation. When the rotation axis does not coincide with the magnetic pole, and the rotation axis sweeps over the earth, pulses will be generated. Some of these pulsars are so stable that they can be compared to the best atomic clocks on earth, so these pulsars are also called atomic clocks in the universe. If you can pick up their signals and know their location, you can use these pulsars for interstellar travel. Question: Which of the following is most likely to be described next? \nA. A. None of the other options are correct. \nB. B. Factors affecting the rotational stability of pulsars \nC. C. Some difficulties faced in interstellar voyage at present \nD. D.

It seems that this is an exposition of the internal relationship between formal beauty and abstract beauty. In fact, it emphasizes that no matter how innovative art creation is, no matter how free it is, it can not be far away from real life. In Wu Guanzhong's view, abstract painting is like flying a kite. A kite is a work, an art form abstracted by materials and feelings from life, abstracted by the author by subtraction, division or other methods, and the audience is the sky. In order for a kite to fly into the sky, the artist must have a thread of connection between the work and the source of life. Only by kite continuous thread can art have its foundation and can it maintain communication with the audience.

According to the secular stagnation theory, this is because the equilibrium real interest rate continues to decline and has fallen into the negative range. The central bank is constrained by the zero zero limit and it is difficult to lower the real interest rate to the equilibrium real interest rate. Therefore, the relatively high real interest rate leads to the continuous suppression of aggregate demand (especially investment demand). That is why, even with zero interest rates in the US, Japan and Europe, output gaps remain negative and recovery is hard to achieve.

The fat in food is mainly in the form of triglycerides. In the digestive tract, fatty acids are hydrolyzed and released by lipase before they are absorbed into the bloodstream and re-synthesized triglycerides. If the lipase is inhibited, the synthesis process can be terminated. In this regard, some researchers have done related experiments. They divided female mice of the same weight into three groups: the first group ate freely, the second group was fed a high-fat diet, and the third group was fed a high-fat diet with a tea saponin extracted from tea. The results showed that from the beginning of the 5th week to the end of the 10th week, the body weight of the second group was significantly higher than that of the first group, but there was no significant difference between the third group and the first group. As a result, the researchers concluded that tea saponin, a natural product, has the ability to inhibit lipase, and people drinking tea can indeed have a weight loss effect. Question: Which of the following, if true, can best question the above conclusions of the researchers? \nA. A. If tea saponin is added to the high-fat diet, the periuterine fat is basically the same as that of mice on a regular diet \nB. B.
