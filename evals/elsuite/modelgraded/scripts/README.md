For my spider demo I am adding synthetic data gen copying the format from [steganography dataset](evals/elsuite/steganography/scripts/dataset/dataset.py).

It is possible that since we are using a generic test, this may not be the optimal place to put spider sql synthetic data generator. But, it teaches us a pattern so its useful.
