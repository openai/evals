After the promotion began, several members of the prominent fitness center canceled their memberships and joined the new gym. When the prominent fitness center withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the members objected and threatened to report the matter to the state consumer protection agency.

Although the plant was constructed in accordance with the best practicable technology, the plant emits a substantial quantity of invisible fumes. The only way the utility company can reduce the fumes is by the use of scrubbing equipment that would cost $50,000,000 to install and would increase the retail price of generated electricity by 50% while reducing the volume of fumes by only 20%. Because of the expense of such equipment and its relative ineffectiveness, no other generating plants burning lignite use such equipment.

The pedestrian's attorney ascertains that there is a statute as alleged by the driver, that his measurements are correct, that there is a state statute requiring observance of traffic lights, and that the driver's license expired two years prior to the collision. The failure of the driver to have a valid driver's license has which of the following effects?\nA. It makes the driver liable to the pedestrian because the driver is a trespasser on the highway.\nB. It would not furnish a basis for liability.\nC. It proves that the driver is an unfit driver in this instance.\nD.

The plaintiff wanted to ask the service manager whether the automobile company would check the muffler on his small foreign car. The plaintiff parked on the street near the service department with the intention of entering that part of the building by walking through one of the three large entrances designed for use by automobiles. There was no street entrance to the service department for individuals, and customers as well as company employees often used one of the automobile entrances. As the plaintiff reached the building, he glanced behind him to be sure no vehicle was approaching that entrance. Seeing none, he walked through the entrance, but immediately he was struck on the back of the head and neck by the large overhead door which was descending. The blow knocked the plaintiff unconscious and caused permanent damage. The plaintiff did not know how the door was raised and lowered; however, the overhead door was operated by the use of either of two switches in the building. One switch was located in the office of the service manager and the other was located near the door in the service work area for the convenience of the mechanics. On this occasion, no one was in the service work area except three mechanics employed by the automobile company. The service manager, who had been in his office, and the three mechanics denied having touched a switch that would have lowered the door. Subsequent investigation showed, however, that the switches were working properly and that all of the mechanisms for moving the door were in good working order. If the plaintiff asserts a claim based on negligence against the automobile company, the plaintiff probably will\nA. recover, because the automobile company is strictly liable under the circumstance.\nB. recover, because an employee of the automobile company was negligent.\nC. not recover, because the plaintiff was a licensee.\nD. not recover, because the plaintiff assumed the risk.\nAnswer:"}],"ideal":"B"}

The plant burns lignite, a low-grade fuel which is available in large quantities. Although the plant was constructed in accordance with the best practicable technology, the plant emits a substantial quantity of invisible fumes. The only way the utility company can reduce the fumes is by the use of scrubbing equipment that would cost $50,000,000 to install and would increase the retail price of generated electricity by 50 percent while reducing the volume of fumes by only 20 percent. Because of the expense of such equipment and its relative ineffectiveness, no other generating plants burning lignite use such equipment. The plant was located in a sparsely settled rural area, remote from the large city served by the utility company. A farmer owned a farm adjacent to the plant. He had farmed the land for 40 years and lived on the premises. The prevailing winds carried fumes from the new plant over the farmer's land. His 2006 crop was less than half the average size of this crop over the five years immediately preceding the construction of the plant. It can be established that the fumes caused the crop reduction. The farmer's hay fever, from which he had long suffered, became worse in 2006. Physicians advised him that the lignite fumes were affecting it and that serious lung disease would soon result unless he moved away from the plant. He did so, selling his farm at its reasonable market value, which was then $10,000 less than before the construction of the plant. If the farmer asserts a claim based on nuisance against the utility company for damages for personal injuries, will the farmer prevail?\nA. No, because there is no practicable way for the utility company to reduce the fumes.\nB. No, because the utility company's acts constituted a public nuisance.\nC.

Just after reaching the east-west crosswalk, the traffic light turned green in her favor. She proceeded about five steps further across the street to the west in the crosswalk when she was struck by a car approaching from her right that she thought would stop, but did not.

As a result of the impact the pedestrian suffered a broken leg and the destruction of her family heirloom, a Picasso original painting that she was taking to her bank for safekeeping. The painting had been purchased by the pedestrian's grandmother for $750 but was valued at $500,000 at the time of the accident. The pedestrian has filed suit against the driver. The driver's attorney has alleged that the pedestrian violated a state statute requiring that pedestrians stay in crosswalks, and that if the pedestrian had not violated the statute she would have had to walk 25 feet more to reach the impact point and therefore would not have been at a place where she could have been hit by the driver. The pedestrian's attorney ascertains that there is a statute as alleged by the driver, that his measurements are correct, that there is a state statute requiring observance of traffic lights, and that the driver's license expired two years prior to the collision.

Thinking the experience would be good for her, the woman recommended her daughter to a parent as a babysitter for his five-year-old child but did not mention her daughter's difficulties or her lack of prior experience as a babysitter. The woman and the parents were longstanding social acquaintances. On the evening the daughter was to babysit, the parents told the daughter that she should treat their child firmly, but that it would be preferable not to spank him since he did not take kindly to it. They did not tell the daughter they had experienced trouble retaining babysitters because of their child's temper tantrums. Later in the evening when the child became angry upon being told to go to his room for being naughty, the daughter spanked him, but only moderately hard. The child then threw a hardcover book at the daughter, hitting her in the eye. As the daughter tried to catch the child to take him to his room, the child fled around the house and out the back door, knocking over and breaking an expensive lamp. The backyard was completely dark. The daughter heard the child screaming and banging at the back door, which had closed and locked automatically, but she did nothing. After 20 minutes had passed, she heard a banging and crying at the front door, but still she did nothing. Then the noise stopped. After a few minutes, the daughter went outside and found the child lying on the steps unconscious and injured.

The pedestrian was in a hurry, and so before reaching the north curb on the street, she cut to her left diagonally across the street to the east-west crosswalk and started across it. Just after reaching the east-west crosswalk, the traffic light turned green in her favor. She proceeded about five steps further across the street to the west in the crosswalk when she was struck by a car approaching from her right that she thought would stop, but did not. The car was driven by a driver, 81 years of age, who failed to stop his car after seeing that the traffic light was red against him. The pedestrian had a bone disease, resulting in very brittle bones, that is prevalent in only 0. 02 percent of the population. As a result of the impact, the pedestrian suffered a broken leg and the destruction of her family heirloom, a Picasso original painting that she was taking to her bank for safekeeping. The painting had been purchased by the pedestrian's grandmother for $750 but was valued at $500,000 at the time of the accident. The pedestrian has filed suit against the driver. The driver's attorney has alleged that the pedestrian violated a state statute requiring that pedestrians stay in crosswalks, and that if the pedestrian had not violated the statute she would have had to walk 25 feet more to reach the impact point and therefore would not have been at a place where she could have been hit by the driver. The pedestrian's attorney ascertains that there is a statute as alleged by the driver, that his measurements are correct, that there is a state statute requiring observance of traffic lights, and that the driver's license expired two years prior to the collision. If the pedestrian establishes liability on the part of the driver for her physical injuries, should the pedestrian's recovery include damages for a broken leg?\nA. No, since only 0. 02 percent of the population have bones as brittle as the pedestrian's.\nB. No, because a person of ordinary health would probably not have suffered a broken leg from the impact.\nC.
