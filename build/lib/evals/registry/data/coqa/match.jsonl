THE ROMAN BARONS \n\nHaving driven Charles VIII out of Italy, it still remained for the allies to remove all traces of his passage from Naples and to restore the rule of the House of Aragon. In this they had the aid of Ferdinand and Isabella, who sent an army under the command of that distinguished soldier Gonzalo de Cordoba, known in his day as the Great Captain. \n\nHe landed in Calabria in the spring of 1496, and war broke out afresh through that already sorely devastated land. The Spaniards were joined by the allied forces of Venice and the Church under the condotta of the Marquis Gonzaga of Mantua, the leader of the Italians at Fornovo. \n\nLodovico had detached himself from the league, and again made terms with France for his own safety's sake. But his cousin, Giovanni Sforza, Tyrant of Pesaro--the husband of Lucrezia Borgia--continued in the pontifical army at the head of a condotta of 600 lances. Another command in the same ranks was one of 700 lances under the youthful Giuffredo Borgia, now Prince of Squillace and the husband of Do\u00f1a Sancia of Aragon, a lady of exceedingly loose morals, who had brought to Rome the habits acquired in the most licentious Court of that licentious age. \n\nThe French lost Naples even more easily than they had conquered it, and by July 7 Ferdinand II was able to reenter his capital and reascend his throne. D'Aubigny, the French general, withdrew to France, whilst Montpensier, the Viceroy, retired to Pozzuoli, where he died in the following year."},{"role":"system","content":"Q: who was driven out of Italy?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: Charles VIII || Having driven Charles VIII out of Italy","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"user","content":"Q: what city did the French lose more easily than they got it?"}],"ideal":["A: Naples"]}

This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire, until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton, now called Plymouth. In 1620, the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony \u2013 the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America. During the English Civil War the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646. \n\nThroughout the Industrial Revolution, Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port, handling imports and passengers from the Americas, and exporting local minerals (tin, copper, lime, china clay and arsenic) while the neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town. In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the county borough of Plymouth, the county borough of Devonport, and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough. The combined town took the name of Plymouth which, in 1928, achieved city status. The city's naval importance later led to its targeting and partial destruction during World War II, an act known as the Plymouth Blitz. After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967."},{"role":"system","content":"Q: What grew as a commercial port during the Industrial Revolution?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: Plymouth || Plymouth","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"user","content":"Q: What is it located on the south coast of?"}],"ideal":["A: Devon"]}

Herrara was delighted to hear that he was to be made a lieutenant-colonel in his army. Bull and Macwitty were overjoyed on hearing that they had both been recommended for commissions, and Herrara's troopers were equally pleased. The rank and file felt no less gratification, both at the honour of being attached to the British army, and at the substantial improvement in their condition that this would entail. \n\nOn the following day Herrara's friends and Mary O'Connor left for Lisbon, and the latter astonished Terence by bursting into tears as she said good-bye to him. \n\n\"I have said nothing yet of the gratitude that I feel to you, Terence, for all that you have done for me, for you have always stopped me whenever I have tried to, but I shall always feel it, always; and shall think of you and love you dearly.\" \n\n\"It has been just as fortunate for me as it has been good for you, Mary,\" he said. \"I have never had a sister, and I seem to have found one now.\" \n\nThe girl looked up, pouting. \"I don't think,\" she said, \"I should particularly care about being a sister; I think that I would rather remain a cousin.\" \n\nTerence looked surprised and a little hurt. \n\n\"You are only a silly boy,\" she laughed, \"but will understand better some day.

Before then I had done bits of reviewing--novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That was how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for television. He hired me, but Tom was not primarily a journalist, or he would certainly have been more careful in choosing his staff. \n\nAt first, his idea was that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film and radio. There would be a weekly lunch at which we would make our choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover, though there would also be guests to make the atmosphere sociable. \n\nIt all felt like a bit of dream at that time: a new newspaper and I was one of the team. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me. Such was my lack of self-confidence. \n\nTom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but we didn't get together as planned and so everything was done by phone. It turned out, too, that the general public out there preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area, and so I chose film. Without Tom's initial push, though, we would hardly have come up with the present arrangement, by which I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film. \n\nThe space I am given allows me to broaden my argument--or forces me, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing. But what is my role in the public arena? I assume that people choose what films to go to on the basis of the stars, the publicity or the director. So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? I certainly don't feel I have a responsibility to be 'right' about a movie. Nor do I think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All I have to do is put forward an argument. I'm not a judge, and nor would I want to be."},{"role":"system","content":"Q: What was their first job?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: Writing articles about films for The Front Page || Writing articles about films for The Front Page","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: Who did they meet?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: editing for the front page ||  I was asked to do for the radio.

The Assembly comprises 60 members, who are known as Assembly Members, or AMs (\"Aelodau y Cynulliad\"). Since 2011, Members are elected for five-year terms under an additional members system, in which 40 AMs represent geographical constituencies elected by the plurality system, and 20 AMs represent five electoral regions using the d'Hondt method of proportional representation. \n\nThe Assembly was created by the Government of Wales Act 1998, which followed a referendum in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to initiate primary legislation until limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006. Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following a Yes vote in the referendum on 3 March 2011, making it possible for it to legislate without having to consult the UK parliament or the Secretary of State for Wales in the 20 areas that are devolved. \n\nAn appointed Council for Wales and Monmouthshire was established in 1949 to \"ensure the government is adequately informed of the impact of government activities on the general life of the people of Wales\". The council had 27 members nominated by local authorities in Wales, the University of Wales, National Eisteddfod Council and the Welsh Tourist Board. A post of Minister of Welsh Affairs was created in 1951 and the post of Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Office were established in 1964 leading to the abolition of the Council for Wales. The establishment of the Welsh Office effectively created the basis for the territorial governance of Wales. The Royal Commission on the Constitution (the Kilbrandon Commission) was set up in 1969 by Harold Wilson's Labour Government to investigate the possibility of devolution for Scotland and Wales. Its recommendations formed the basis of the 1974 White Paper \"Democracy and Devolution: proposals for Scotland and Wales\", which proposed the creation of a Welsh Assembly. However, voters rejected the proposals by a majority of four to one in a referendum held in 1979."},{"role":"system","content":"Q: what is it commonly known as","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: the Welsh Assembly || The National Assembly for Wales (; commonly known as the Welsh Assembly","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: what does the assembly do","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: legislates || Welsh Assembly) is a devolved assembly with power to make legislation in Wales","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: how many people are in it","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: 60 || The Assembly comprises 60 members","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: for how long","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: five-years || Since 2011, Members are elected for five-year terms","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: what do 40 of them represent","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: geographical constituencies || 40 AMs represent geographical constituencies elected by the plurality system","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: and the other 20?","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: five electoral regions || 20 AMs represent five electoral regions","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: using what","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: the d'Hondt method of proportional representation. || 20 AMs represent five electoral regions using the d'Hondt method of proportional representation.","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: who created the assembly","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: The Assembly was created by the Government of Wales Act 1998 || The Assembly was created by the Government of Wales Act 1998","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: following what","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: a referendum || Act 1998, which followed a referendum","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"system","content":"Q: what year did they receive law making power through an act","name":"example_user"},{"role":"system","content":"A: 2006 || limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006","name":"example_assistant"},{"role":"user","content":"Q: are they now able to make laws without having to consult UK"}],"ideal":["A: Yes","A: yes"]}
